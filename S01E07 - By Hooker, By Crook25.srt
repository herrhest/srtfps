1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,011
Narrator:. In the criminal justice
system, the people are represented

2
00:00:06,048 --> 00:00:08,349
by two separate yet
equally important groups-

3
00:00:08,384 --> 00:00:10,173
the police,
who investigate crime,

4
00:00:10,207 --> 00:00:13,054
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

5
00:00:13,087 --> 00:00:15,062
These are their stories.

6
00:00:23,871 --> 00:00:25,781
Man: So we go into this place-

7
00:00:25,823 --> 00:00:27,645
this SRO
up on 113th Street,

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,720
and we hear this guy,
muffled like,

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,535
going, "Help, help, "
but inside someplace.

10
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:35,956
we search. we can't find this guy.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,690
This room is maybe
12' by 12'

12
00:00:37,728 --> 00:00:39,550
There's not a lot
of space to hide.

13
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:42,071
Can't find him,
until Handler looks up,

14
00:00:42,111 --> 00:00:44,533
and sees this guy-
jaybird naked

15
00:00:44,575 --> 00:00:46,680
gaffer-taped
to the ceiling.

16
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,443
I'm telling you-

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,454
Hey, hey! My dog!

18
00:00:50,495 --> 00:00:52,503
He just found
something down there!

19
00:00:52,544 --> 00:00:54,584
I think it's a guy
or something.

20
00:00:54,623 --> 00:00:56,794
I don't know
if he's dead or hurt!

21
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,904
Oh, my God!
Somebody-

22
00:00:58,944 --> 00:01:01,693
Back here.

23
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:06,298
It's right over here. At first I
thought it was a glove or something.

24
00:01:06,336 --> 00:01:09,183
Look at it.

25
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:20,117
Ready? Lift.
Yeah.

26
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,505
He's hurt pretty bad,
but he's not dead.

27
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,365
I. D.? Nope, nothing on him.

28
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,400
Hey, Bobby, make sure
you bag it all!

29
00:01:34,751 --> 00:01:37,337
Max:
He gonna wake up?

30
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:39,099
The nurses' pool
says no.

31
00:01:39,135 --> 00:01:42,102
How much is in the pot? 30 bucks.

32
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,347
If they were sure,
there'd be at least 100.

33
00:01:44,384 --> 00:01:47,166
He's got a shot.
Come here, let me show you.

34
00:01:48,383 --> 00:01:51,700
There's a hairline fracture
and subdural hematoma.

35
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:54,493
Bad enough, but it
looks worse than it is.

36
00:01:54,528 --> 00:01:57,659
Just a love tap. whoever did
it wasn't trying to kill him.

37
00:01:57,695 --> 00:02:00,117
I'm sure his family will
find that comforting.

38
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,810
The blow to the head doesn't worry
me as much as the heart attack.

39
00:02:02,847 --> 00:02:04,986
Heart attack? Caused by the blow.

40
00:02:05,023 --> 00:02:07,893
Impossible to tell. He could
have had the heart attack first.

41
00:02:07,935 --> 00:02:10,008
But...

42
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,317
there is one odd thing. Yeah?

43
00:02:12,351 --> 00:02:14,653
His underpants
were on backwards.

44
00:03:40,128 --> 00:03:42,233
Logan: Ugh
- what the hell is that?

45
00:03:42,271 --> 00:03:44,311
Glass eye- garbage.

46
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:46,653
Hey, listen
to this.

47
00:03:46,688 --> 00:03:49,590
when I worked the 9th, we'd
get a scratch, Tompkins Square,

48
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:52,447
so we nose around the parks,
the streets, blah, blah, blah.

49
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:54,301
What do we find
under the bench?

50
00:03:54,336 --> 00:03:55,743
A hand-
a human hand

51
00:03:55,775 --> 00:03:57,783
with the watch
still on the wrist, ticking.

52
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,580
Ugh!

53
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:02,168
Brontosaurus rex-
garbage.

54
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,248
Rolling papers...

55
00:04:04,288 --> 00:04:05,913
maybe.

56
00:04:10,623 --> 00:04:12,565
Bingo!

57
00:04:14,911 --> 00:04:16,504
All right!

58
00:04:16,543 --> 00:04:19,478
7:00 or 8:00,
I don't know.

59
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,592
Dinner was on the table
when he called.

60
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,541
Did you know
where he was going?

61
00:04:23,584 --> 00:04:26,748
Just that he had
to work late,

62
00:04:26,783 --> 00:04:30,012
and... I'm sorry.

63
00:04:30,048 --> 00:04:31,771
I was up
most of the night.

64
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,150
These pictures just came back
from being processed.

65
00:04:42,176 --> 00:04:44,085
May I?

66
00:04:45,312 --> 00:04:47,483
woman:
I don't understand.

67
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,367
Irv doesn't work anywhere
near Central Park.

68
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,309
where does he work?

69
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:55,068
Max: So, you left with Mr. Diamond?

70
00:04:55,104 --> 00:04:56,729
woman:
About 5: 30.

71
00:04:56,768 --> 00:04:58,939
He said he wanted
to discuss receivables-

72
00:04:58,975 --> 00:05:01,310
over a drink
at Jangle's.

73
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:04,213
Did you do a lot of your work
with him over drinks?

74
00:05:04,256 --> 00:05:07,005
I like my job-
but not that much.

75
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,855
Thank you.

76
00:05:18,367 --> 00:05:20,090
Man:
Sure, I remember him.

77
00:05:20,128 --> 00:05:22,648
Comes in here once
or twice a month,

78
00:05:22,688 --> 00:05:24,760
"window shopping,"

79
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:26,392
then he goes home
to the wifey.

80
00:05:26,432 --> 00:05:27,446
what about
last night?

81
00:05:27,488 --> 00:05:29,397
Last night he's with
some knockout

82
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:31,861
who's trying to pretend
she's got nothing to look at.

83
00:05:31,904 --> 00:05:34,937
Now me, I wouldn't
go near one like that.

84
00:05:34,976 --> 00:05:37,725
First it's "Don't
touch, don't touch, "

85
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,280
and then it's
"why not? why not?"

86
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,905
Did you think they were
gonna go take a swim,

87
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:45,278
or just sit
on the beach?

88
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:47,678
She wasn't
interested.

89
00:05:47,712 --> 00:05:50,079
The guy was in heat.
He's pawing her,

90
00:05:50,111 --> 00:05:52,730
she's got zero interest
and she walks.

91
00:05:52,768 --> 00:05:54,262
And...?
And-

92
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,343
in come
the "BBQs"-

93
00:05:56,383 --> 00:05:59,166
Brooklyn-Bronx-Queens-

94
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,403
the bridge-
and-tunnel set.

95
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,414
Teased-hair
teasers.

96
00:06:03,455 --> 00:06:06,903
He goes after three in
a row, bim, bam, bom.

97
00:06:06,943 --> 00:06:09,758
The Mike Tyson
of romance.

98
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:11,385
I mean,
dead meat.

99
00:06:11,423 --> 00:06:14,772
So... I buy him
a drink,

100
00:06:14,815 --> 00:06:16,920
he buys himself
a couple or three more,

101
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,327
and by the time
he left,

102
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:22,010
he couldn't walk.

103
00:06:23,359 --> 00:06:24,734
Thanks.

104
00:06:30,271 --> 00:06:32,889
Another strikeout.
what have we got left?

105
00:06:32,928 --> 00:06:35,349
Five block radius,
we got the Pequot,

106
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:37,246
the Standish,
the Stanley.

107
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,840
Then you get past that
- Then?!

108
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,694
In his condition, you think he'd
make it more than five blocks?

109
00:06:41,728 --> 00:06:44,248
Let's work the phones. I
don't want this to get cold.

110
00:06:44,288 --> 00:06:47,037
I don't get it, Max. It's
just a little "humma-humma. "

111
00:06:47,072 --> 00:06:50,203
Did you see the pictures?
So? Lots of vics got kids.

112
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:53,054
Until you have some,
you won't understand.

113
00:06:55,327 --> 00:06:57,847
Mr. Diamond-
ah, yes.

114
00:06:57,888 --> 00:06:59,862
He checked in
last night,

115
00:06:59,904 --> 00:07:02,587
about 8:00- alone,

116
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:05,274
no luggage, gold card.

117
00:07:05,312 --> 00:07:07,002
Maid just cleared up
his room.

118
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,665
The maid quarters
are downstairs?

119
00:07:08,704 --> 00:07:10,526
Uh-huh.
Thanks a lot.

120
00:07:13,664 --> 00:07:16,511
Did you clean his room
this morning?

121
00:07:16,544 --> 00:07:19,511
Did you see anything
out of the ordinary?

122
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,918
Signs of a fight,
blood?

123
00:07:23,264 --> 00:07:25,598
Did he use
his bed?

124
00:07:25,632 --> 00:07:28,185
Did you find
anything in the room?

125
00:07:29,503 --> 00:07:31,511
Please get it-
please.

126
00:07:44,543 --> 00:07:46,169
"Personals
for Pleasure. "

127
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,268
A sports fan.

128
00:07:49,311 --> 00:07:52,126
Gracias. Don't read
that, you'll go blind.

129
00:07:59,488 --> 00:08:01,397
wait a minute...

130
00:08:05,055 --> 00:08:06,811
Man:
50 cents!

131
00:08:06,848 --> 00:08:09,914
I've been working hotels
for 40 years,

132
00:08:09,952 --> 00:08:13,116
and I ain't seen a two-bit tip
since those Kennedys been in office.

133
00:08:13,151 --> 00:08:14,744
You see what
I'm getting at?

134
00:08:14,784 --> 00:08:17,337
Then this duke
asks me about

135
00:08:17,376 --> 00:08:18,554
getting a girl.

136
00:08:18,592 --> 00:08:20,479
And I tell him-

137
00:08:20,512 --> 00:08:23,163
"A big tipper like you
don't need no girl. "

138
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,817
And that's when he
ordered the champagne?

139
00:08:25,856 --> 00:08:28,638
No, later.
He ordered two glasses,

140
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:31,868
so I figure he solved
that problem by himself.

141
00:08:31,903 --> 00:08:34,238
Now, when I get
to his room,

142
00:08:34,271 --> 00:08:36,660
he's in his drawers
and socks,

143
00:08:36,703 --> 00:08:38,613
and on the bed
is this blonde.

144
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:42,135
A cute little thing
with a farmgirl face.

145
00:08:42,176 --> 00:08:44,314
The "farmgirl"
got a name?

146
00:08:44,352 --> 00:08:47,734
Everyone got a name, but he don't
call her nothing that I hear.

147
00:08:47,776 --> 00:08:49,401
They talk about
anything?

148
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,643
She's talking,
and talking to him,

149
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,135
and I figure she's
talking a little lovey.

150
00:08:54,175 --> 00:08:56,412
But she wasn't
talking that.

151
00:08:56,447 --> 00:08:58,269
what were they
talking about?

152
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:01,566
Pool!

153
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:04,250
20th precinct shoots
tomorrow night, fellows.

154
00:09:04,287 --> 00:09:06,491
Sergeant Greevey,
Detective Logan.

155
00:09:06,528 --> 00:09:08,797
which one of us
got a problem?

156
00:09:08,831 --> 00:09:10,293
Logan: A blonde.
That's helpful.

157
00:09:10,335 --> 00:09:13,182
we're looking for a young girl
with a fresh face,

158
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,393
happens to be a blonde.

159
00:09:14,431 --> 00:09:16,668
Very wholesome,
likes to play pool.

160
00:09:16,703 --> 00:09:19,737
Ring a bell?
Could be Jolene.

161
00:09:19,776 --> 00:09:21,532
She in some kind
of trouble?

162
00:09:23,167 --> 00:09:25,077
I don't know
her last name.

163
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,356
Green League, Tuesdays.

164
00:09:27,392 --> 00:09:30,653
She started playing in July. I
remember she came in after the 4th.

165
00:09:30,688 --> 00:09:34,332
what team she play on? They call
themselves the "Femme Fatales. "

166
00:09:34,368 --> 00:09:36,156
Can you believe that?
Pool's "in. "

167
00:09:36,192 --> 00:09:38,396
We got all kinds of teams,
girl teams, gay teams.

168
00:09:38,431 --> 00:09:41,213
we even got a team of transvestites
- as long as they pay their fee.

169
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,452
How does she pay?
Cash or check?

170
00:09:43,487 --> 00:09:45,789
Check,
some business-

171
00:09:45,823 --> 00:09:47,711
funny name.

172
00:09:47,743 --> 00:09:49,783
Messilina.

173
00:09:49,824 --> 00:09:51,733
Max:
Yeah?

174
00:09:52,735 --> 00:09:54,590
Yeah!

175
00:09:54,624 --> 00:09:56,566
Correspondence Unit
report on Messilina.

176
00:09:56,608 --> 00:09:59,357
No liens, no credit
codes, no judgments,

177
00:09:59,392 --> 00:10:02,207
no records of any
Messilina Corporation.

178
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:03,865
Hold on.

179
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,943
I got a DBA.

180
00:10:05,983 --> 00:10:07,707
County clerk?
Yeah.

181
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:10,427
"Messilina Enterprises
doing business-

182
00:10:10,463 --> 00:10:12,219
as 'Poppy Catering"'

183
00:10:14,688 --> 00:10:16,379
Address?

184
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,107
"6-8-9

185
00:10:18,143 --> 00:10:20,248
East 79th Street. "

186
00:10:20,288 --> 00:10:23,287
That puts it right in the
middle of the East River!

187
00:10:23,328 --> 00:10:25,597
Thanks.

188
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,916
Great.

189
00:10:29,952 --> 00:10:32,505
what now.

190
00:10:32,543 --> 00:10:36,504
Our Mr. Diamond, maybe he'll
wake up and tell us what happened.

191
00:10:36,543 --> 00:10:38,453
Oh, yeah, right.

192
00:10:39,744 --> 00:10:42,461
This Diamond guy,
he's got a nice wife,

193
00:10:42,495 --> 00:10:45,529
he's got three kids. what's
he doing going to a hooker?

194
00:10:45,568 --> 00:10:48,186
Your objection
moral or economic?

195
00:10:48,223 --> 00:10:51,093
I'll tell you this,
I'm never gonna pay for it.

196
00:10:51,135 --> 00:10:53,240
Let's talk about it

197
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,930
after you've been married
for 20 or 30 years,

198
00:10:55,968 --> 00:10:58,204
and have nothing more
to look forward to

199
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,247
than "more of the same
home cooking. "

200
00:11:00,287 --> 00:11:01,781
what are you saying?
You'd do it?!

201
00:11:01,824 --> 00:11:05,119
Me? I'm lucky.
I like my wife's cooking.

202
00:11:05,151 --> 00:11:08,250
But I don't judge.

203
00:11:08,288 --> 00:11:11,484
You can never know
someone else's story.

204
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,414
wait a minute!
"Poppy Catering"?

205
00:11:15,455 --> 00:11:16,917
Yeah?

206
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,032
"Poppy Escorts"!

207
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,009
Pow!

208
00:11:31,007 --> 00:11:33,342
what can I tell you?
That's the way I like them-

209
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,764
young, fresh, blonde-

210
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,946
wholesome, like they
just came off a farm.

211
00:11:37,983 --> 00:11:40,733
Thank you.

212
00:11:46,271 --> 00:11:48,890
Just a minute.

213
00:11:50,528 --> 00:11:52,502
Be right there.

214
00:11:57,535 --> 00:11:59,291
Coming, coming.

215
00:12:01,119 --> 00:12:03,836
Here I am.
Sorry.

216
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:08,123
Hi, guy.
Hi.

217
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,429
I'm Jolene.

218
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:12,852
You can
call me Mike.

219
00:12:12,895 --> 00:12:15,743
I'll call you "Daisy"
if you want-

220
00:12:15,775 --> 00:12:17,848
but what's
your real name?

221
00:12:18,911 --> 00:12:20,570
Mike.

222
00:12:23,584 --> 00:12:26,169
where are you from...
"Mike"?

223
00:12:28,703 --> 00:12:30,525
Upstate.

224
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,277
I sure hope
you have a plane ticket.

225
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,782
Uh...

226
00:12:45,535 --> 00:12:48,023
Now, Mike...
you're not

227
00:12:48,063 --> 00:12:50,267
the kind of guy
who would take offense

228
00:12:50,304 --> 00:12:52,278
if I asked you
a personal question?

229
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,807
No, not at all.

230
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,074
Are you a cop?

231
00:13:01,888 --> 00:13:04,506
No, why?
Your shoes.

232
00:13:04,543 --> 00:13:06,878
Brogans.
And knit socks.

233
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,033
Cop shoes,
cop socks.

234
00:13:11,072 --> 00:13:12,959
Look...

235
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,814
I'm not a cop.

236
00:13:22,783 --> 00:13:25,533
It's $220
for a half-hour,

237
00:13:25,568 --> 00:13:27,706
$250 for an hour,

238
00:13:27,744 --> 00:13:31,060
and for that
you get "straight,"

239
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:33,242
or "half and half. "

240
00:13:37,215 --> 00:13:40,477
what do you say
to that- "Mike"?

241
00:13:40,511 --> 00:13:42,616
I say,
"You're under arrest. "

242
00:13:49,984 --> 00:13:52,504
You said you
weren't a cop.

243
00:13:53,728 --> 00:13:55,516
I lied.

244
00:13:55,552 --> 00:13:58,170
Isn't there some kind of
illegal thing about that?

245
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,866
what? Lying?

246
00:13:59,903 --> 00:14:03,002
I'm allowed to lie.
They pay me to lie.

247
00:14:06,816 --> 00:14:08,791
It doesn't seem right.

248
00:14:10,144 --> 00:14:12,762
Maybe we can
work something out.

249
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,509
Like what?

250
00:14:16,543 --> 00:14:18,813
we know you were
with a guy named Diamond

251
00:14:18,847 --> 00:14:20,702
the night before last.
what happened?

252
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:24,667
The night before last?

253
00:14:26,527 --> 00:14:28,283
I was...

254
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,478
"upstate. "

255
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:35,131
Max!
Hospital just called.

256
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:36,989
Diamond had
another coronary.

257
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,280
He's dead.

258
00:14:45,695 --> 00:14:47,932
I sure hope you have
a plane ticket.

259
00:14:53,471 --> 00:14:55,381
You don't
understand.

260
00:14:55,424 --> 00:14:58,970
I didn't realize
he was still alive.

261
00:14:59,008 --> 00:15:02,008
I thought
he was dead.

262
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:06,108
I've never seen
anyone die before.

263
00:15:06,143 --> 00:15:08,282
Honey, just tell us
what happened.

264
00:15:11,424 --> 00:15:13,977
I called my driver.

265
00:15:14,016 --> 00:15:16,699
He was waiting for me
in the garage.

266
00:15:16,736 --> 00:15:19,703
He told me to split.

267
00:15:21,536 --> 00:15:24,056
So I went home.

268
00:15:24,095 --> 00:15:25,851
You didn't try
to give him CPR?

269
00:15:25,888 --> 00:15:29,019
Oh, God! I didn't know
he was still alive.

270
00:15:29,056 --> 00:15:30,812
He wasn't breathing.

271
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:33,881
I got scared,
okay?

272
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,019
I would never just
leave somebody to die.

273
00:15:38,656 --> 00:15:41,590
Do you think
he would have been-

274
00:15:41,631 --> 00:15:43,126
all right?

275
00:15:43,168 --> 00:15:45,339
How did he get
to Central Park?

276
00:15:46,944 --> 00:15:48,853
I don't know.

277
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:52,922
You'd have to ask Cookie.
Cookie Molina.

278
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,782
The driver.

279
00:15:54,815 --> 00:15:56,855
where can we
find him?

280
00:15:56,896 --> 00:15:58,968
In his car, I guess.

281
00:15:59,007 --> 00:16:02,171
He works out at
the west End Garage.

282
00:16:06,304 --> 00:16:08,159
Max: You guys know
a guy named Cookie?

283
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,362
Yeah, he's right
over there. Thanks.

284
00:16:19,936 --> 00:16:21,910
Yo! Cookie Molina?

285
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,792
who wants to know.

286
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,937
I thought "Cookie"
was a girl's name.

287
00:16:26,976 --> 00:16:28,863
Come on, get out
of the car, get out.

288
00:16:30,912 --> 00:16:32,188
Cops!

289
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:33,947
So, tell us
about Mr. Diamond.

290
00:16:33,984 --> 00:16:35,838
Never heard
of him.

291
00:16:35,872 --> 00:16:38,392
Oh! I hope you belong
to a softball league, Cookie.

292
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:40,220
He must be
an all-star.

293
00:16:40,256 --> 00:16:43,005
He's hitting the ball so hard,
he's making it bleed.

294
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,179
Logan: Mr. Diamond
- they found

295
00:16:45,216 --> 00:16:47,223
tiny, wooden slivers
in his head.

296
00:16:47,263 --> 00:16:49,086
Somebody hit him
with something.

297
00:16:49,119 --> 00:16:50,908
Yeah, something-
like this.

298
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,147
Like a bat. Could've
even been this bat.

299
00:16:53,184 --> 00:16:55,006
And since you
don't know Mr. Diamond,

300
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,527
we'll take it down to the
lab and see what they turn up.

301
00:16:57,567 --> 00:17:00,863
Look, the guy, Diamond,
was dead before I hit him.

302
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:02,302
Heart attack.

303
00:17:02,336 --> 00:17:03,863
Logan:
Wrong order, Cookie.

304
00:17:03,904 --> 00:17:06,075
Heart attack,
you hit him...

305
00:17:06,111 --> 00:17:07,835
then he died.

306
00:17:07,871 --> 00:17:09,976
No way, he was history
in the room.

307
00:17:10,016 --> 00:17:12,187
I'm afraid the hospital
where he croaked,

308
00:17:12,223 --> 00:17:13,816
would disagree.

309
00:17:13,856 --> 00:17:16,441
why don't you just
talk it through, hmm?

310
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,334
Blow-by-blow.

311
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,941
Jolene beeps me.

312
00:17:21,984 --> 00:17:23,544
I go up-

313
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,077
the john's lying there.

314
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,902
He ain't moving.
He ain't breathing.

315
00:17:27,935 --> 00:17:29,594
I call Jasmine-

316
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,454
Jasmine?

317
00:17:31,488 --> 00:17:34,106
She runs the day-to-day.
I tell her, "we got trouble. "

318
00:17:34,143 --> 00:17:36,118
She puts me
on hold,

319
00:17:36,159 --> 00:17:38,069
comes back a minute later and says,

320
00:17:38,112 --> 00:17:40,283
"Dress the guy. "
Diamond?

321
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,116
Diamond. "Pretend he's
drunk, take him to the car,

322
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,094
dump him someplace,
make it look like a mugging. "

323
00:17:47,135 --> 00:17:49,045
So I drive the car
to the park,

324
00:17:49,087 --> 00:17:50,974
dump him,
turn out his pockets,

325
00:17:51,007 --> 00:17:53,211
toss his key and wallet
into the bushes.

326
00:17:53,247 --> 00:17:57,404
Then you hit him. when I
told Jasmine, she freaked.

327
00:17:57,439 --> 00:17:59,349
"what did ya do that for?"
she's screaming.

328
00:17:59,392 --> 00:18:02,458
It's not
my fault.

329
00:18:02,495 --> 00:18:04,884
She said, "Make it
look like a mugging. "

330
00:18:04,928 --> 00:18:06,651
You did
a good job.

331
00:18:06,687 --> 00:18:08,597
I can see
the future.

332
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,284
Oh yeah? You guys are
gonna read me my rights.

333
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,326
Sultry woman:
Hello.

334
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,847
I'm Jasmine.

335
00:18:33,888 --> 00:18:35,775
Hello.

336
00:18:35,808 --> 00:18:38,109
I believe you
asked for me?

337
00:18:39,423 --> 00:18:41,147
Yeah.

338
00:18:49,152 --> 00:18:50,330
First time?

339
00:18:50,368 --> 00:18:52,670
what?!

340
00:18:52,703 --> 00:18:54,427
First time here?

341
00:18:54,464 --> 00:18:56,886
Yeah.

342
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:00,660
well, relax, hmm?

343
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,615
we're gonna have
a good time.

344
00:19:06,655 --> 00:19:10,038
Did they explain
the rates downstairs?

345
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,422
No.

346
00:19:11,455 --> 00:19:13,365
It's $250
an hour,

347
00:19:13,408 --> 00:19:16,255
I... don't
do halves,

348
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:20,925
and I only do
straight sex.

349
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,847
Congratulations-

350
00:19:22,879 --> 00:19:25,301
you just said
the magic word.

351
00:19:30,528 --> 00:19:32,350
Look at me,
I'm overweight.

352
00:19:32,383 --> 00:19:34,772
Suppose I had a bad
heart like Diamond,

353
00:19:34,816 --> 00:19:36,310
doesn't that
bother you?

354
00:19:36,352 --> 00:19:37,694
Give me a break.

355
00:19:37,727 --> 00:19:40,029
Does Jack LaLanne
ask for a cardiogram?

356
00:19:40,063 --> 00:19:42,485
Johns are big boys.

357
00:19:42,527 --> 00:19:44,021
If they choose to go
to an escort i service-

358
00:19:44,064 --> 00:19:46,551
You mean "whorehouse", don't you?

359
00:19:46,592 --> 00:19:49,013
You know, you should
have sent your partner.

360
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:51,259
I don't usually
do discipline,

361
00:19:51,296 --> 00:19:53,849
but I would love
to teach him some manners.

362
00:20:01,535 --> 00:20:04,667
whoa! In and out
- just like work, huh?

363
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,842
I'm only as quick
as the guy I'm with.

364
00:20:06,879 --> 00:20:09,148
You- look like
under a minute.

365
00:20:09,184 --> 00:20:12,664
Joe, her lawyer-
this guy AuClair,

366
00:20:12,703 --> 00:20:14,427
just set a new record,
bail in under an hour.

367
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,798
You know anything about
him? He dresses sharp.

368
00:20:16,831 --> 00:20:19,548
Aside from that. I've never seen
him around these parts before.

369
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:21,013
Not a regular
pross-pumper.

370
00:20:21,056 --> 00:20:22,485
what do you
think?

371
00:20:22,528 --> 00:20:24,600
Of a hooker who's got
a lawyer who looks like

372
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,647
he spends more on clothes
than I make in a year?

373
00:20:26,687 --> 00:20:29,502
I think whoever's paying
his bill ought to adopt me.

374
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:35,647
Logan: what's it been, eight hours?

375
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,679
I hate this.

376
00:20:38,719 --> 00:20:40,028
what do we got?

377
00:20:40,064 --> 00:20:41,973
well...

378
00:20:42,016 --> 00:20:44,023
Jasmine's lawyer-

379
00:20:44,063 --> 00:20:46,005
Roger AuClair, Esquire,

380
00:20:46,047 --> 00:20:48,414
has never handled
a pross bust before.

381
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:52,890
In the last three years,
AuClair handled

382
00:20:52,928 --> 00:20:54,815
only 34
criminal cases.

383
00:20:54,848 --> 00:20:57,695
Nothing complicated, all
the rest corporate stuff.

384
00:20:57,728 --> 00:20:59,767
Favors
for corporate clients.

385
00:20:59,808 --> 00:21:02,328
He's the firm's fixer.

386
00:21:05,247 --> 00:21:07,703
19 drug-related
charges,

387
00:21:07,744 --> 00:21:10,526
seven larceny
or shoplifting,

388
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,770
six assault,

389
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:15,156
wife-beating, husband-beating,
pet poodle-beating.

390
00:21:15,199 --> 00:21:18,134
More dropped charges.

391
00:21:20,511 --> 00:21:22,202
what do you say
we pack it in,

392
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,280
catch a couple
or three hours sleep?

393
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,108
Roach coach j is open.

394
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:28,566
Let's get some
fresh coffee.

395
00:21:30,368 --> 00:21:32,734
Five possibilities
left, Max.

396
00:21:34,943 --> 00:21:36,765
There you go,
have a good day.

397
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,076
Hey!

398
00:21:38,112 --> 00:21:40,414
we should have started
at the other end of the pile.

399
00:21:40,447 --> 00:21:43,960
Four months ago, AuClair
starts a Theft of Services case

400
00:21:43,999 --> 00:21:46,487
against a guy named
Stringfellow, on behalf of-

401
00:21:46,527 --> 00:21:48,022
Poppy Catering!

402
00:21:48,064 --> 00:21:50,519
Stringfellow's wife-
she won't pay the bill.

403
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,593
This is the part
of the job that I like.

404
00:21:53,632 --> 00:21:56,152
Beautiful, Max.

405
00:21:56,192 --> 00:21:59,836
Mrs. Stringfellow: Yes, we are
being sued by Poppy Catering.

406
00:21:59,871 --> 00:22:02,206
But, gentlemen,
they are not caterers.

407
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:04,541
They are whores.

408
00:22:04,576 --> 00:22:06,747
Whores
my husband used.

409
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:08,507
And charged
on his gold card.

410
00:22:08,543 --> 00:22:12,820
Yes, but I'm sure
I don't need to remind you

411
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:16,573
that a contract entered into
for an illegal act-

412
00:22:16,608 --> 00:22:18,396
is void.

413
00:22:18,432 --> 00:22:20,603
In any case,
I certainly

414
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,712
do not intend
to pay this bill.

415
00:22:22,751 --> 00:22:24,824
It's the principle
of the thing.

416
00:22:24,863 --> 00:22:26,619
And what about
the publicity?

417
00:22:26,656 --> 00:22:29,111
I had a little
research done.

418
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:34,329
The woman who is running
"Poppy Catering,"

419
00:22:34,367 --> 00:22:36,189
this whorehouse,

420
00:22:36,224 --> 00:22:39,224
is a winthrop.

421
00:22:39,263 --> 00:22:41,434
Laura winthrop.

422
00:22:41,472 --> 00:22:43,414
Her mother
is a Matthews.

423
00:22:43,455 --> 00:22:46,008
I went to Spence
with her.

424
00:22:46,047 --> 00:22:48,382
Laura...

425
00:22:48,415 --> 00:22:50,303
is a very capable
woman.

426
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:52,124
She holds an MBA
from Harvard.

427
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,415
Imagine, my husband
paid $1, 000

428
00:22:56,447 --> 00:22:58,389
for four hours' i service.

429
00:23:00,031 --> 00:23:03,162
That's almost as much as
I'm paying my divorce lawyer.

430
00:23:07,392 --> 00:23:09,214
Got everything?
we all set?

431
00:23:09,248 --> 00:23:11,353
we got our warrant,
what else do we need?

432
00:23:11,392 --> 00:23:13,148
You're cranky when you
don't sleep at night.

433
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,071
Cranky?
I love this.

434
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:17,046
Let's go bust
a prostitute.

435
00:23:17,088 --> 00:23:19,543
whoo! Look at the
size of this place.

436
00:23:24,224 --> 00:23:26,591
Max: Police here to
see Laura winthrop.

437
00:23:28,191 --> 00:23:29,850
Search warrant!

438
00:23:29,887 --> 00:23:32,637
Max: Laura Winthrop, you have
the right to remain silent

439
00:23:32,671 --> 00:23:35,224
and refuse to answer
questions. Do you understand?

440
00:23:37,567 --> 00:23:39,509
How does
the defendant plead?

441
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:40,828
Not guilty,
Your Honor.

442
00:23:40,863 --> 00:23:42,456
I assume you are
requesting bail?

443
00:23:42,496 --> 00:23:44,154
AuClair:.
We are, Your Honor.

444
00:23:44,191 --> 00:23:47,006
Prosecution does not consider Ms.
winthrop a flight risk, Your Honor.

445
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,982
However, the 35-woman
prostitution ring,

446
00:23:49,024 --> 00:23:51,162
which the defendant ran,
is one of the largest

447
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,339
and most lucrative
uncovered in recent years.

448
00:23:53,376 --> 00:23:55,580
Listen up, Andrew,
and get some pointers!

449
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:00,508
I gather this is alleged to be
an efficiently run business?

450
00:24:00,544 --> 00:24:02,551
Stone: Thoroughly
computerized, with a client list

451
00:24:02,591 --> 00:24:04,315
that includes
doctors, diplomats,

452
00:24:04,351 --> 00:24:06,718
CEO's of some of the city's
largest corporations-

453
00:24:06,752 --> 00:24:08,028
Judge: Get to the point, Mr. Stone.

454
00:24:08,064 --> 00:24:10,169
Despite the impressive
list of assets,

455
00:24:10,207 --> 00:24:12,029
promoting prostitution

456
00:24:12,064 --> 00:24:13,951
is still merely
a Class D felony.

457
00:24:13,984 --> 00:24:16,024
This office requests
bail commensurate

458
00:24:16,064 --> 00:24:17,755
with the serious impact
of the crime

459
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,482
on the moral fibre
of this community.

460
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:21,243
Ya hear that, Andrew?.
Fiber!

461
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,516
I told you
we all need fiber!

462
00:24:24,992 --> 00:24:26,901
Ladies
and gentlemen!

463
00:24:26,943 --> 00:24:28,853
I realize it's late,

464
00:24:28,896 --> 00:24:31,547
and all of us, including me,
would rather be somewhere else,

465
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:35,096
but since we are compelled
to spend some time together,

466
00:24:35,135 --> 00:24:36,891
perhaps we could
have a little order?!

467
00:24:36,928 --> 00:24:39,416
Bail, $5, 000.

468
00:24:42,463 --> 00:24:44,373
Pardon?
watch your step.

469
00:24:44,415 --> 00:24:46,782
Reporter:...
excessive? No, not at all.

470
00:24:46,816 --> 00:24:49,630
Will this affect your catering
- Yes, and they weren't even invited.

471
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:51,093
And here I am at night
court in my pearls-

472
00:24:51,135 --> 00:24:52,345
Counselor!

473
00:24:52,384 --> 00:24:53,660
You're treading water.

474
00:24:53,696 --> 00:24:56,030
My client invested
in the catering business.

475
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,998
She knew nothing about, and had
nothing to do with prostitution.

476
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,269
The records we got in the bust give
us a good start proving otherwise.

477
00:25:02,303 --> 00:25:04,474
Circumstantial
at best.

478
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:07,381
See you in court.

479
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:10,423
winthrop:.. This city?
I can't imagine.

480
00:25:11,871 --> 00:25:13,278
It stinks.

481
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:16,062
The DA ain't gonna give you
a total walk, Cookie.

482
00:25:16,095 --> 00:25:18,681
You want to nail
winthrop?

483
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,054
I can sing you
a top-10 hit,

484
00:25:21,088 --> 00:25:24,633
but I gotta slide to a
misdemeanor and time served.

485
00:25:28,287 --> 00:25:29,662
Give him
the walk.

486
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,288
If people
only knew.

487
00:25:31,328 --> 00:25:34,045
Do you know how many
john's heads this jerk

488
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,022
has probably
hit fungos with?

489
00:25:36,063 --> 00:25:38,398
I don't care if he's
the damned "Sultan of Swat. "

490
00:25:38,431 --> 00:25:40,504
I'm hunting
for bigger fish, Max.

491
00:25:40,544 --> 00:25:43,326
Her operation could kill
hundreds. The deal is approved.

492
00:25:56,896 --> 00:25:58,489
"Million Dollar Madam.

493
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,764
Blueblood busted
in prostitution ring.

494
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,174
Cops called her Madame. "

495
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:04,062
what do the telephone records say?

496
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:06,812
No calls to or from her
apartment to the whorehouse.

497
00:26:06,848 --> 00:26:08,408
She's smart.

498
00:26:08,447 --> 00:26:10,138
But sloppy.

499
00:26:10,175 --> 00:26:12,663
Last February- the heat
went off in the whorehouse.

500
00:26:12,703 --> 00:26:15,802
winthrop called the people who
managed the building to complain.

501
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,742
She was so snobby
on the phone.

502
00:26:18,784 --> 00:26:21,337
when she called, she clearly
identified herself?

503
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:23,579
Not just on the phone,
she came in.

504
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:27,128
Oh- would you like
a danish or some coffee?

505
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:29,623
No, thanks. Manager:. what a scene.

506
00:26:29,663 --> 00:26:33,046
You know, plumbers are not the
easiest thing to get in New York City.

507
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:35,957
Not in the middle of winter, in
the middle of the dinner hour.

508
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,295
I mean, it takes time,
it takes a lot of doing.

509
00:26:39,327 --> 00:26:41,629
But not
for "Miss Impatience," no.

510
00:26:41,664 --> 00:26:44,631
well, maybe it's easier
in hoity-toity Connecticut.

511
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:47,453
She said she was
from Connecticut? No!

512
00:26:47,488 --> 00:26:49,822
She reminds me of my
sister-in-law from Connecticut.

513
00:26:49,856 --> 00:26:51,711
Ma'am, is this the
woman who complained?

514
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:54,525
Yeah.

515
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,113
Yeah, she even looks
like my sister-in-law.

516
00:27:06,016 --> 00:27:07,804
Did you copy
the whole trick book?

517
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,320
Just the A-list. 15 names,
each worth over a hundred mil.

518
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:14,840
Phipps MacKenzie,
Colin Metcalf, David Hamilton-

519
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,985
it reads like
the Social Register.

520
00:27:19,776 --> 00:27:21,467
Child: One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

521
00:27:21,503 --> 00:27:23,543
Anyone around
my base is it!

522
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:25,688
I understand
your position.

523
00:27:25,728 --> 00:27:27,735
But you understand,
I'm sure, there's...

524
00:27:27,775 --> 00:27:29,783
no way I could
testify.

525
00:27:29,824 --> 00:27:31,711
I understand your
position, Mr. Hamilton,

526
00:27:31,744 --> 00:27:33,500
but you're gonna
be under subpoena.

527
00:27:33,535 --> 00:27:36,153
I don't have to remind you what
the penalties are for perjury.

528
00:27:36,192 --> 00:27:38,101
You put me
on the stand,

529
00:27:38,143 --> 00:27:40,510
and I'll make
damn sure you spend

530
00:27:40,544 --> 00:27:43,643
the rest of your insignificant
career prosecuting jaywalkers.

531
00:27:45,888 --> 00:27:48,092
Thanks for your time,
Mr. Hamilton.

532
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,615
And I hope your grandson
has a happy birthday.

533
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,189
Ben!

534
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:14,331
Looking for
our lunch date?

535
00:28:14,367 --> 00:28:16,190
I didn't know
we were on for lunch.

536
00:28:16,223 --> 00:28:17,717
we're not.

537
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,702
Oh...
Hello, Paul.

538
00:28:19,744 --> 00:28:21,718
Still flacking
for the mayor?

539
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,956
You know, Paul, I really love your
partner, here, so does the mayor, Ben.

540
00:28:24,992 --> 00:28:27,774
He especially loves the work
you've been doing on prostitution.

541
00:28:27,807 --> 00:28:30,971
He really thinks you should have
a bigger staff, a bigger budget.

542
00:28:31,008 --> 00:28:32,917
Maybe... there should be
a task force,

543
00:28:32,959 --> 00:28:35,829
which as you know, since crack
has become much more visible,

544
00:28:35,872 --> 00:28:39,101
much more aggressive,
a major task force-

545
00:28:39,136 --> 00:28:41,372
major effort.
what do you think, Ben?

546
00:28:41,408 --> 00:28:43,644
Are you
interested?

547
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,851
I think we ought to put stocks
- two to a block,

548
00:28:45,887 --> 00:28:48,375
guarded and heated
- all the way up and down Broadway.

549
00:28:48,415 --> 00:28:50,270
Anyone convicted
of possession of crack

550
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,693
has to sit in those stocks
from sunup till sundown,

551
00:28:52,736 --> 00:28:56,151
with a dunce cap and clown nose
- we'd clear up the problem in six months.

552
00:28:56,191 --> 00:28:57,718
what do you think?

553
00:28:57,759 --> 00:28:59,766
If that's the way you
want to play it, Ben.

554
00:29:06,272 --> 00:29:08,028
Gentlemen.

555
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:13,661
Ms. winthrop's friends
are getting nervous.

556
00:29:13,696 --> 00:29:16,062
They're going to be
looking for a scapegoat-

557
00:29:16,095 --> 00:29:18,746
like maybe Jolene and Cookie
conspired to roll Diamond.

558
00:29:18,783 --> 00:29:21,783
we've got to make sure Jolene
is not connected to Cookie.

559
00:29:21,823 --> 00:29:23,711
Check the bat,

560
00:29:23,743 --> 00:29:25,631
make sure her prints
aren't on it.

561
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:27,638
Get a sample of her blood,

562
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,876
make sure there's no match with
the blood found on Cookie's bat.

563
00:29:30,911 --> 00:29:33,083
All cliches are true.

564
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,429
Such as?

565
00:29:34,464 --> 00:29:37,780
"Politics makes
strange bedfellows. "

566
00:29:43,776 --> 00:29:45,499
Murder two?!
That's absurd.

567
00:29:45,536 --> 00:29:48,765
Diamond died. You can't prove that
was a result of a blow to the head.

568
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,061
I think I can prove your client had
reckless disregard for human life.

569
00:29:52,096 --> 00:29:54,332
Bull! Yeah? Let's see
what the jury has to say.

570
00:29:55,296 --> 00:29:57,205
Counselor!

571
00:29:58,528 --> 00:30:00,350
All right,
all right.

572
00:30:00,384 --> 00:30:03,733
She'll plead to
promoting prostitution.

573
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:06,493
I want her
to do time.

574
00:30:06,527 --> 00:30:09,113
what are you,
a religious fanatic?

575
00:30:09,151 --> 00:30:12,250
And more than one year.
I want prison, not jail.

576
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,304
AuClair wants
to make a deal.

577
00:30:25,344 --> 00:30:27,416
And? I'm tempted. Is
that the lab report?

578
00:30:27,455 --> 00:30:29,310
The wood fiber found
in Diamond's head matches-

579
00:30:29,344 --> 00:30:31,449
Cookie's bat. The
blood type on the bat-

580
00:30:31,487 --> 00:30:33,276
Matched Diamond's?
Some of it does.

581
00:30:33,311 --> 00:30:35,733
There are other types.
So, what's the problem?

582
00:30:35,775 --> 00:30:37,848
All the lab reports j came in-

583
00:30:37,888 --> 00:30:39,775
including Jolene's.

584
00:30:39,808 --> 00:30:41,947
Her blood
was on the bat?

585
00:30:41,984 --> 00:30:44,318
No... it wasn't that,
but...

586
00:30:44,352 --> 00:30:48,029
there's a new blind screening
program for HIV.

587
00:30:48,063 --> 00:30:50,136
She's got AIDS?

588
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,182
Makes her a hell
of a compelling witness.

589
00:30:56,224 --> 00:30:59,453
The public health angle
is explosive.

590
00:31:01,407 --> 00:31:04,724
Actually, I'm glad
you called, Mr. Stone.

591
00:31:04,768 --> 00:31:07,256
I've decided
not to testify.

592
00:31:07,296 --> 00:31:09,630
I'll plead to
the prostitution charge.

593
00:31:11,392 --> 00:31:13,694
I'm sorry.
I really am.

594
00:31:13,727 --> 00:31:15,931
I know you were
counting on my testimony,

595
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:17,855
but Laura winthrop's
been good to me.

596
00:31:17,888 --> 00:31:19,481
That's not
why we're here.

597
00:31:22,367 --> 00:31:24,440
It's not?!

598
00:31:25,792 --> 00:31:27,701
why?

599
00:31:29,376 --> 00:31:31,678
The blood sample
that was taken...

600
00:31:33,152 --> 00:31:35,802
it became part
of a blind test.

601
00:31:42,112 --> 00:31:44,217
what kind of test?

602
00:31:49,247 --> 00:31:51,102
An AIDS test?

603
00:31:51,136 --> 00:31:53,853
They did an HIV test?

604
00:31:54,976 --> 00:31:56,405
Yes.

605
00:31:58,847 --> 00:32:00,408
No.

606
00:32:00,448 --> 00:32:02,587
No, I was tested.

607
00:32:02,624 --> 00:32:05,242
Two months ago.

608
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,767
All positives
are double-checked.

609
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:28,245
Health food.

610
00:32:35,167 --> 00:32:37,884
Robinette: we've got her nailed
on the prostitution charge.

611
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,570
It's the other charges that
are gonna put her behind bars.

612
00:32:40,608 --> 00:32:43,455
As my Dad used to say, "Unless
you're holding a full house-

613
00:32:43,488 --> 00:32:45,659
jacks high or better-
call, don't raise. "

614
00:32:45,695 --> 00:32:47,735
Your dad was
a philosopher.

615
00:32:47,776 --> 00:32:50,426
with Jolene and Cookie,
I'm still in the game.

616
00:32:50,464 --> 00:32:52,700
Sounds like
a low pair to me.

617
00:32:55,872 --> 00:32:59,766
Your wife has been an invalid
for 14 years, is that correct?

618
00:32:59,808 --> 00:33:01,913
Yes. Stone: During that time,

619
00:33:01,951 --> 00:33:05,693
have you had any occasion to
use the services of prostitutes?

620
00:33:05,728 --> 00:33:07,222
witness:
Yes.

621
00:33:07,263 --> 00:33:10,297
Stone: How many? Maybe... 2,000.

622
00:33:12,927 --> 00:33:14,935
Have you ever used
the same woman twice?

623
00:33:14,976 --> 00:33:16,732
Not often.

624
00:33:16,767 --> 00:33:20,116
Most of the girls weren't worth
using once, let alone twice.

625
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:25,784
what about
Jolene Curtis?

626
00:33:25,824 --> 00:33:27,514
Jolene?

627
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:30,105
I used her whenever
she was available.

628
00:33:30,143 --> 00:33:32,827
She's very, very good
at what she does.

629
00:33:32,864 --> 00:33:35,515
what does she do?

630
00:33:35,551 --> 00:33:38,006
Oh, she gets you
very, very excited.

631
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:40,087
whatever she does,

632
00:33:40,128 --> 00:33:41,589
is it hard
on the heart?

633
00:33:41,631 --> 00:33:45,822
She's hard
on everything.

634
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:53,594
Stone: Mr. Hamilton, can you tell
me about the whipping incident?

635
00:33:53,632 --> 00:33:57,342
what I did at Ms. winthrop's
establishment,

636
00:33:57,375 --> 00:34:01,237
didn't exactly involve
any whipping.

637
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,167
wasn't a whip
in the room?

638
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:10,136
was anyone
holding the whip?

639
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,423
The young lady.

640
00:34:14,463 --> 00:34:17,049
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.
would you please speak up?

641
00:34:17,087 --> 00:34:20,022
The young woman...

642
00:34:20,063 --> 00:34:24,089
was holding the whip.

643
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:26,429
I don't recall her name.

644
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:29,398
Your witness.

645
00:34:37,472 --> 00:34:39,773
I know
how awkward-

646
00:34:39,808 --> 00:34:42,012
how embarrassing

647
00:34:42,047 --> 00:34:44,316
this situation
must be for you.

648
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:47,167
I wonder
if you would mind

649
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,436
elaborating
on your visit

650
00:34:49,471 --> 00:34:51,773
to Ms. winthrop's
service?

651
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:56,374
with the young woman,
about the whip...

652
00:34:58,015 --> 00:35:00,863
she only used it
to dress up.

653
00:35:02,303 --> 00:35:05,303
Playing...
make-believe?

654
00:35:05,343 --> 00:35:07,580
Yes.

655
00:35:07,615 --> 00:35:09,852
AuClair:.
Helping to alleviate

656
00:35:09,887 --> 00:35:11,895
the perfectly
understandable

657
00:35:11,936 --> 00:35:15,929
ennui that comes after
so many years of marriage?

658
00:35:15,968 --> 00:35:19,448
They're buying it. Yep.

659
00:35:19,487 --> 00:35:21,942
Cookie: Jasmine had to
check with Winthrop whenever

660
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,926
there were problems
with the clients.

661
00:35:23,968 --> 00:35:26,521
Stone: These clients, were
they generally healthy or not?

662
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:28,021
Sure, the service
had clients

663
00:35:28,064 --> 00:35:30,104
who weren't in
the best of health.

664
00:35:30,143 --> 00:35:32,729
Men with bad hearts,
like Mr. Diamond?

665
00:35:32,767 --> 00:35:35,156
I don't know about
Mr. Diamond's heart.

666
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:38,199
Did any other of her clients
have bad hearts?

667
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:40,890
Look, their hearts-

668
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:43,229
that's not the part
of their anatomy

669
00:35:43,264 --> 00:35:45,435
the girls were most
involved with.

670
00:35:47,648 --> 00:35:49,687
Answer the question,
Mr. Molina.

671
00:35:49,728 --> 00:35:52,826
A lot of the guys
I drive,

672
00:35:52,864 --> 00:35:55,384
I heard them complaining
to the girls

673
00:35:55,423 --> 00:35:57,049
about their wives,

674
00:35:57,087 --> 00:35:59,476
their work.

675
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,236
They're a tense breed-
workaholics.

676
00:36:02,272 --> 00:36:04,508
what was Ms. winthrop's
attitude toward them?

677
00:36:04,544 --> 00:36:06,431
I never met
Ms. winthrop.

678
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:09,977
I know, but you must have overheard
conversations she'd had about them.

679
00:36:10,015 --> 00:36:12,765
Yeah, with Jasmine.

680
00:36:12,799 --> 00:36:15,582
They were in the coffee
shop near the service.

681
00:36:15,615 --> 00:36:18,844
They didn't see me. They were joking
about the "hard-driving johns. "

682
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,702
what was her
attitude?

683
00:36:20,735 --> 00:36:22,045
Objection.

684
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,316
Supposition on the part
of the witness.

685
00:36:24,352 --> 00:36:27,668
He has no idea what Ms.
winthrop had in mind.

686
00:36:27,711 --> 00:36:29,948
I'll rephrase
the question.

687
00:36:29,983 --> 00:36:32,798
Can you tell me exactly
what Ms. winthrop said?

688
00:36:32,832 --> 00:36:35,515
Oh, yeah,
it stuck in my mind.

689
00:36:35,552 --> 00:36:38,007
She said,
"A deuce-"

690
00:36:38,047 --> 00:36:39,738
that's a two-hour
j session-

691
00:36:39,775 --> 00:36:41,848
"will either kill 'em
or cure 'em,

692
00:36:41,887 --> 00:36:43,797
and I don't care
which,

693
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,295
as long as their gold
cards are still good. "

694
00:36:46,335 --> 00:36:49,052
AuClair:. Your Honor,
this man is despicable.

695
00:36:49,088 --> 00:36:51,641
He's made
a deal to walk.

696
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,397
Yeah, but it didn't
affect my memory.

697
00:37:00,608 --> 00:37:03,063
I hear you're in trouble.
Check your sources.

698
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,991
Molina gave us an early
Christmas present.

699
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,468
what was AuClair's
reaction?

700
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:11,391
Still wants
to make a deal.

701
00:37:11,424 --> 00:37:14,685
Yeah, well...
you want my advice?

702
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,964
Make the deal.

703
00:37:15,999 --> 00:37:19,098
You can't prove
Winthrop gave the order.

704
00:37:19,135 --> 00:37:21,077
Why not?

705
00:37:22,752 --> 00:37:25,141
what makes this case
so important?

706
00:37:26,303 --> 00:37:28,540
Adam,
you got me wrong.

707
00:37:28,575 --> 00:37:30,462
Are you going to make
a deal with AuClair?

708
00:37:30,495 --> 00:37:32,699
No, I mean they're
all important.

709
00:37:34,655 --> 00:37:36,859
It's going to be
very bad if she walks.

710
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:39,711
She won't walk!

711
00:37:39,743 --> 00:37:42,710
Stone: As a member of the
Health and Human Resources Board,

712
00:37:42,752 --> 00:37:44,956
you worked on the mayor's
AIDS white paper?

713
00:37:44,992 --> 00:37:46,781
I did.
In that report,

714
00:37:46,815 --> 00:37:49,368
how many prostitutes were
presumed to be HIV-positive?

715
00:37:49,407 --> 00:37:51,796
From 70 to 85%.

716
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:55,320
It's difficult to be more precise
because of the virus' incubation time.

717
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,010
It ranges from months
up to 10 years.

718
00:37:58,047 --> 00:38:00,503
Thank you
very much.

719
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:04,821
I only just found out
I've got the AIDS virus.

720
00:38:04,863 --> 00:38:07,733
Stone: How many men did you
have sexual intercourse with

721
00:38:07,776 --> 00:38:10,875
in the 18 months you worked
for Ms. Laura Winthrop?

722
00:38:12,799 --> 00:38:14,971
800.

723
00:38:15,007 --> 00:38:17,527
Maybe 1, 000.

724
00:38:17,568 --> 00:38:20,350
Am I missing something
here? she's our witness.

725
00:38:20,383 --> 00:38:23,231
watch. And during those 18 months,

726
00:38:23,263 --> 00:38:25,980
you worked solely
for Ms. winthrop?

727
00:38:26,016 --> 00:38:28,699
Yes. Stone: Your witness.

728
00:38:33,632 --> 00:38:36,053
Ms. Curtis...

729
00:38:36,095 --> 00:38:37,983
I'm sure that
you're aware,

730
00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:40,382
the incubation period
for HIV

731
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:42,521
can be up
to 10 years?

732
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:44,283
Yes.
Ms. Curtis,

733
00:38:44,319 --> 00:38:46,294
j j
were you a virgin

734
00:38:46,335 --> 00:38:48,342
before you began
your association

735
00:38:48,384 --> 00:38:50,587
with Poppy Escorts?

736
00:38:52,032 --> 00:38:54,999
Mmm...

737
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:58,487
A simple "yes" or
"no" will suffice.

738
00:38:59,743 --> 00:39:01,532
No.

739
00:39:01,568 --> 00:39:04,121
No further questions.

740
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,843
Redirect, Your Honor.
Go ahead, Mr. Stone.

741
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,051
Jolene...

742
00:39:10,847 --> 00:39:12,505
before you
went to work-

743
00:39:12,544 --> 00:39:15,544
for Ms. Winthrop, how many
men had you slept with?

744
00:39:15,584 --> 00:39:18,170
Three.

745
00:39:18,208 --> 00:39:21,656
And to your knowledge,
are they all healthy?

746
00:39:25,759 --> 00:39:28,410
They're very healthy.

747
00:39:28,448 --> 00:39:32,823
The prosecution rests,
Your Honor.

748
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:36,410
AuClair:. Ms. winthrop, are you concerned
about the health of your employees?

749
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:38,968
Yes, I'm quite concerned
about the health of my girls.

750
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,895
Along with
regular check-ups,

751
00:39:40,928 --> 00:39:43,164
I insist they carry
medical insurance.

752
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,069
You urge them
to seek psychotherapy?

753
00:39:46,111 --> 00:39:47,933
Yes, that's one
of the reasons

754
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,270
I insist they carry
medical insurance.

755
00:39:50,303 --> 00:39:53,053
It pays for the therapy.
We do encourage it.

756
00:39:53,087 --> 00:39:54,942
Thank you.

757
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:57,342
Your witness, j sir.

758
00:39:57,375 --> 00:40:01,019
Ms. winthrop, this insistence
on health insurance,

759
00:40:01,056 --> 00:40:02,550
and medical
check-ups,

760
00:40:02,591 --> 00:40:04,479
do you do this
out of altruism?

761
00:40:04,511 --> 00:40:08,024
Let's say- enlightened
self-interest.

762
00:40:08,064 --> 00:40:10,006
If my male guests were
to pick up a bug-

763
00:40:10,048 --> 00:40:12,666
Ms. winthrop, do you
consider AIDS a "bug"?

764
00:40:12,703 --> 00:40:15,256
AIDS is a very
serious disease, Mr. Stone.

765
00:40:15,296 --> 00:40:18,460
That's why I don't want anyone
in my little family infected.

766
00:40:18,495 --> 00:40:20,950
So you screen
prospective employees

767
00:40:20,991 --> 00:40:22,617
and if any of them
tested positive-

768
00:40:22,655 --> 00:40:23,833
I wouldn't
hire her.

769
00:40:23,871 --> 00:40:26,327
And they wouldn't be part
of your "little family"?

770
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:28,343
My "little family"
was the best

771
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,718
finishing school
on the East Coast.

772
00:40:30,752 --> 00:40:33,402
Girls came to me
without education,

773
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,829
without wit,
without class.

774
00:40:35,872 --> 00:40:38,622
I taught them how to speak,
how to dress.

775
00:40:38,655 --> 00:40:41,405
After a year, these
i naive young women

776
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,130
leamed
sophistication.

777
00:40:43,167 --> 00:40:46,266
And for that, Ms. winthrop,
shame on you.

778
00:40:46,303 --> 00:40:49,303
You act as though
I don't care about them.

779
00:40:49,344 --> 00:40:50,937
Let's talk about that.

780
00:40:50,976 --> 00:40:53,397
Have you ever tried
to help any of these girls,

781
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,545
like the ones
that you didn't hire?

782
00:40:55,583 --> 00:40:57,045
No.

783
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:59,259
If they had ever
tested positive for AIDS-

784
00:40:59,296 --> 00:41:01,434
They would have to stop
working for me.

785
00:41:01,472 --> 00:41:03,228
In the past
three years,

786
00:41:03,263 --> 00:41:05,597
how many of your
long-term employees

787
00:41:05,632 --> 00:41:07,519
have stopped
working for you

788
00:41:07,552 --> 00:41:09,974
because they tested
positive for AIDS?

789
00:41:11,711 --> 00:41:13,402
I'd say
about a dozen.

790
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,709
Have you tried
to help any of them?

791
00:41:16,671 --> 00:41:18,460
No.

792
00:41:18,496 --> 00:41:20,438
Have you visited
any of them?

793
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:24,222
Have you?

794
00:41:24,256 --> 00:41:25,946
No.

795
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:28,504
Do you even know
what's happened to them?

796
00:41:28,543 --> 00:41:30,813
Tried to find out?

797
00:41:32,063 --> 00:41:33,754
No.

798
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:36,126
I've never tried
to find out.

799
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:40,923
Ms. winthrop, how much money do you
make from your business in one year?

800
00:41:40,959 --> 00:41:43,064
In this past year?
Yeah.

801
00:41:43,104 --> 00:41:45,046
I really
don't know.

802
00:41:46,207 --> 00:41:48,214
$100,00?
Probably.

803
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:50,525
One million? I don't think so.

804
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:52,217
Oh?

805
00:41:52,256 --> 00:41:54,874
I do think
you do think so.

806
00:41:54,911 --> 00:41:59,319
I think that you made
$1,672,000.

807
00:42:00,704 --> 00:42:02,526
At least,
that's what you stated,

808
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,691
on your New York State
income tax return.

809
00:42:05,727 --> 00:42:07,931
And with all
that money,

810
00:42:07,968 --> 00:42:10,750
you didn't help
these girls once.

811
00:42:10,783 --> 00:42:13,653
And as for your customers-
Ms. winthrop,

812
00:42:13,695 --> 00:42:15,637
have you ever tried

813
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,981
to contact customers

814
00:42:18,016 --> 00:42:20,285
and warn them
that they had slept

815
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,708
with women who are
HIV-positive?

816
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,346
No.

817
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:34,271
Ms. winthrop,
I can't hear you.

818
00:42:34,304 --> 00:42:36,191
would you please
speak up?

819
00:42:36,224 --> 00:42:38,199
No.

820
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,923
So isn't it true, Ms. winthrop,
that you are creating

821
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,610
an atmosphere of reckless
disregard for human life

822
00:42:43,648 --> 00:42:46,015
which must inevitably
lead to someone's death,

823
00:42:46,047 --> 00:42:48,316
one way
or another?

824
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,647
All right, Stone,
what do you want?

825
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:01,534
Make me an offer.

826
00:43:01,568 --> 00:43:04,884
winthrop: why don't we hear Mr.
Stone's thoughts on the matter first?

827
00:43:04,927 --> 00:43:08,058
I think it might be more appropriate
if you let your lawyer handle this.

828
00:43:08,096 --> 00:43:10,943
If you don't mind, I find
this quite fascinating.

829
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,890
How about involuntary
manslaughter?

830
00:43:20,928 --> 00:43:23,961
I can be out
in five years, right?

831
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,887
Two and a half
with good behavior.

832
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,919
I'm always on my best
behavior, Mr. Stone.

833
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,028
It's a deal.

834
00:43:50,047 --> 00:43:52,862
Reporter:. Excuse, me,
Miss, can we get a comment

835
00:43:52,895 --> 00:43:54,422
from you on
the winthrop case?

836
00:43:54,463 --> 00:43:56,252
You were the foreman
of the jury,

837
00:43:56,288 --> 00:43:58,589
could you tell what the
verdict would have been?

838
00:43:58,624 --> 00:44:00,533
I can't speak
for the others-

839
00:44:00,575 --> 00:44:02,812
she seemed like
such a nice girl-

840
00:44:02,847 --> 00:44:05,630
uh, a real lady.
Still...

841
00:44:05,663 --> 00:44:08,085
I probably would have
voted to convict.

842
00:44:08,128 --> 00:44:09,535
Thank you.

843
00:44:09,567 --> 00:44:12,415
Robinette: Maybe you
shouldn't have done a deal.

844
00:44:12,447 --> 00:44:14,836
Maybe...

845
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,181
but it ain't bad
for a pair of treys.

1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:06,268
Narrator:. In the criminal justice
system, the people are represented

2
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:08,706
by two separate yet
equally important groups-

3
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:10,607
the police,
who investigate crime,

4
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:13,612
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

5
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:15,705
These are their stories.

6
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:26,882
Man: So we go into this place-

7
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:28,826
this SRO
up on 113th Street,

8
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,989
and we hear this guy,
muffled like,

9
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:34,967
going, "Help, help, "
but inside someplace.

10
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:37,492
we search. we can't find this guy.

11
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,300
This room is maybe
12' by 12'

12
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:41,239
There's not a lot
of space to hide.

13
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:43,868
Can't find him,
until Handler looks up,

14
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,435
and sees this guy-
jaybird naked

15
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,674
gaffer-taped
to the ceiling.

16
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,512
I'm telling you-

17
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,609
Hey, hey! My dog!

18
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:54,745
He just found
something down there!

19
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:56,915
I think it's a guy
or something.

20
00:00:56,956 --> 00:00:59,220
I don't know
if he's dead or hurt!

21
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:01,420
Oh, my God!
Somebody-

22
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:04,328
Back here.

23
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:09,129
It's right over here. At first I
thought it was a glove or something.

24
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:12,138
Look at it.

25
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:23,539
Ready? Lift.
Yeah.

26
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,114
He's hurt pretty bad,
but he's not dead.

27
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:30,054
I. D.? Nope, nothing on him.

28
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,218
Hey, Bobby, make sure
you bag it all!

29
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:41,494
Max:
He gonna wake up?

30
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:43,331
The nurses' pool
says no.

31
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:46,463
How much is in the pot? 30 bucks.

32
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:48,804
If they were sure,
there'd be at least 100.

33
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:51,743
He's got a shot.
Come here, let me show you.

34
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:56,470
There's a hairline fracture
and subdural hematoma.

35
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:59,383
Bad enough, but it
looks worse than it is.

36
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:02,684
Just a love tap. whoever did
it wasn't trying to kill him.

37
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:05,247
I'm sure his family will
find that comforting.

38
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,055
The blow to the head doesn't worry
me as much as the heart attack.

39
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:10,324
Heart attack? Caused by the blow.

40
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:13,355
Impossible to tell. He could
have had the heart attack first.

41
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:15,560
But...

42
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,968
there is one odd thing. Yeah?

43
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:20,404
His underpants
were on backwards.

44
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,724
Logan: Ugh
- what the hell is that?

45
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:53,891
Glass eye- garbage.

46
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:56,333
Hey, listen
to this.

47
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:59,395
when I worked the 9th, we'd
get a scratch, Tompkins Square,

48
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,374
so we nose around the parks,
the streets, blah, blah, blah.

49
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,308
What do we find
under the bench?

50
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:05,811
A hand-
a human hand

51
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:07,938
with the watch
still on the wrist, ticking.

52
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,812
Ugh!

53
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:12,511
Brontosaurus rex-
garbage.

54
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,679
Rolling papers...

55
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,416
maybe.

56
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,352
Bingo!

57
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:27,459
All right!

58
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,560
7:00 or 8:00,
I don't know.

59
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,764
Dinner was on the table
when he called.

60
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,796
Did you know
where he was going?

61
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:38,140
Just that he had
to work late,

62
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:41,544
and... I'm sorry.

63
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:43,378
I was up
most of the night.

64
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,157
These pictures just came back
from being processed.

65
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:56,218
May I?

66
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,761
woman:
I don't understand.

67
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,768
Irv doesn't work anywhere
near Central Park.

68
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,793
where does he work?

69
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:07,670
Max: So, you left with Mr. Diamond?

70
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,402
woman:
About 5: 30.

71
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,706
He said he wanted
to discuss receivables-

72
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:14,178
over a drink
at Jangle's.

73
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:17,205
Did you do a lot of your work
with him over drinks?

74
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,117
I like my job-
but not that much.

75
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,088
Thank you.

76
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:33,761
Man:
Sure, I remember him.

77
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,428
Comes in here once
or twice a month,

78
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,630
"window shopping,"

79
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,332
then he goes home
to the wifey.

80
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:41,431
what about
last night?

81
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:43,465
Last night he's with
some knockout

82
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,034
who's trying to pretend
she's got nothing to look at.

83
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,242
Now me, I wouldn't
go near one like that.

84
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:52,149
First it's "Don't
touch, don't touch, "

85
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,813
and then it's
"why not? why not?"

86
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,550
Did you think they were
gonna go take a swim,

87
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,024
or just sit
on the beach?

88
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:02,527
She wasn't
interested.

89
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:05,030
The guy was in heat.
He's pawing her,

90
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:07,794
she's got zero interest
and she walks.

91
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,392
And...?
And-

92
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:11,562
in come
the "BBQs"-

93
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:14,505
Brooklyn-Bronx-Queens-

94
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,838
the bridge-
and-tunnel set.

95
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,935
Teased-hair
teasers.

96
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:22,573
He goes after three in
a row, bim, bam, bom.

97
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:25,550
The Mike Tyson
of romance.

98
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,246
I mean,
dead meat.

99
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:30,778
So... I buy him
a drink,

100
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:33,018
he buys himself
a couple or three more,

101
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,527
and by the time
he left,

102
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,325
he couldn't walk.

103
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,165
Thanks.

104
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:49,669
Another strikeout.
what have we got left?

105
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:52,234
Five block radius,
we got the Pequot,

106
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,212
the Standish,
the Stanley.

107
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,874
Then you get past that
- Then?!

108
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,850
In his condition, you think he'd
make it more than five blocks?

109
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:01,513
Let's work the phones. I
don't want this to get cold.

110
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:04,421
I don't get it, Max. It's
just a little "humma-humma. "

111
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:07,722
Did you see the pictures?
So? Lots of vics got kids.

112
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,695
Until you have some,
you won't understand.

113
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:15,693
Mr. Diamond-
ah, yes.

114
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:17,794
He checked in
last night,

115
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:20,635
about 8:00- alone,

116
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:23,437
no luggage, gold card.

117
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:25,239
Maid just cleared up
his room.

118
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,973
The maid quarters
are downstairs?

119
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:28,913
Uh-huh.
Thanks a lot.

120
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:35,154
Did you clean his room
this morning?

121
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:38,282
Did you see anything
out of the ordinary?

122
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:40,792
Signs of a fight,
blood?

123
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,629
Did he use
his bed?

124
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:47,326
Did you find
anything in the room?

125
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,794
Please get it-
please.

126
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,078
"Personals
for Pleasure. "

127
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,310
A sports fan.

128
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:12,290
Gracias. Don't read
that, you'll go blind.

129
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,957
wait a minute...

130
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:27,602
Man:
50 cents!

131
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,837
I've been working hotels
for 40 years,

132
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:34,176
and I ain't seen a two-bit tip
since those Kennedys been in office.

133
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:35,874
You see what
I'm getting at?

134
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:38,577
Then this duke
asks me about

135
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:39,846
getting a girl.

136
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,854
And I tell him-

137
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:44,652
"A big tipper like you
don't need no girl. "

138
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,420
And that's when he
ordered the champagne?

139
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,361
No, later.
He ordered two glasses,

140
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:53,729
so I figure he solved
that problem by himself.

141
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:56,200
Now, when I get
to his room,

142
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:58,726
he's in his drawers
and socks,

143
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:00,762
and on the bed
is this blonde.

144
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:04,435
A cute little thing
with a farmgirl face.

145
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,707
The "farmgirl"
got a name?

146
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:10,273
Everyone got a name, but he don't
call her nothing that I hear.

147
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:12,011
They talk about
anything?

148
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,349
She's talking,
and talking to him,

149
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,947
and I figure she's
talking a little lovey.

150
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:19,321
But she wasn't
talking that.

151
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:21,258
what were they
talking about?

152
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:24,695
Pool!

153
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,494
20th precinct shoots
tomorrow night, fellows.

154
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,831
Sergeant Greevey,
Detective Logan.

155
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:32,235
which one of us
got a problem?

156
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:33,795
Logan: A blonde.
That's helpful.

157
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,808
we're looking for a young girl
with a fresh face,

158
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:38,070
happens to be a blonde.

159
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,442
Very wholesome,
likes to play pool.

160
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:43,642
Ring a bell?
Could be Jolene.

161
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,514
She in some kind
of trouble?

162
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:49,210
I don't know
her last name.

163
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,587
Green League, Tuesdays.

164
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:55,025
She started playing in July. I
remember she came in after the 4th.

165
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:58,861
what team she play on? They call
themselves the "Femme Fatales. "

166
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,763
Can you believe that?
Pool's "in. "

167
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,098
We got all kinds of teams,
girl teams, gay teams.

168
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,036
we even got a team of transvestites
- as long as they pay their fee.

169
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,370
How does she pay?
Cash or check?

170
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:10,807
Check,
some business-

171
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:12,811
funny name.

172
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:14,972
Messilina.

173
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:17,005
Max:
Yeah?

174
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,984
Yeah!

175
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,044
Correspondence Unit
report on Messilina.

176
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,955
No liens, no credit
codes, no judgments,

177
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,926
no records of any
Messilina Corporation.

178
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,655
Hold on.

179
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:31,822
I got a DBA.

180
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:33,661
County clerk?
Yeah.

181
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:36,497
"Messilina Enterprises
doing business-

182
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:38,366
as 'Poppy Catering"'

183
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,703
Address?

184
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:44,505
"6-8-9

185
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:46,738
East 79th Street. "

186
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:49,907
That puts it right in the
middle of the East River!

187
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,315
Thanks.

188
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,819
Great.

189
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:59,518
what now.

190
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:03,688
Our Mr. Diamond, maybe he'll
wake up and tell us what happened.

191
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:05,720
Oh, yeah, right.

192
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,899
This Diamond guy,
he's got a nice wife,

193
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:13,098
he's got three kids. what's
he doing going to a hooker?

194
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,869
Your objection
moral or economic?

195
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:18,900
I'll tell you this,
I'm never gonna pay for it.

196
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:21,139
Let's talk about it

197
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,944
after you've been married
for 20 or 30 years,

198
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:26,315
and have nothing more
to look forward to

199
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,445
than "more of the same
home cooking. "

200
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:30,045
what are you saying?
You'd do it?!

201
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:33,525
Me? I'm lucky.
I like my wife's cooking.

202
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:36,790
But I don't judge.

203
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:40,162
You can never know
someone else's story.

204
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:44,260
wait a minute!
"Poppy Catering"?

205
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:45,827
Yeah?

206
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,203
"Poppy Escorts"!

207
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,307
Pow!

208
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,953
what can I tell you?
That's the way I like them-

209
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:05,479
young, fresh, blonde-

210
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:07,754
wholesome, like they
just came off a farm.

211
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:10,660
Thank you.

212
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:19,165
Just a minute.

213
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:22,932
Be right there.

214
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,011
Coming, coming.

215
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,750
Here I am.
Sorry.

216
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,220
Hi, guy.
Hi.

217
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,624
I'm Jolene.

218
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,151
You can
call me Mike.

219
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:47,165
I'll call you "Daisy"
if you want-

220
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:49,360
but what's
your real name?

221
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:52,198
Mike.

222
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:58,037
where are you from...
"Mike"?

223
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,579
Upstate.

224
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,448
I sure hope
you have a plane ticket.

225
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,146
Uh...

226
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,824
Now, Mike...
you're not

227
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:23,164
the kind of guy
who would take offense

228
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:25,261
if I asked you
a personal question?

229
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,898
No, not at all.

230
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,304
Are you a cop?

231
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:38,011
No, why?
Your shoes.

232
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,484
Brogans.
And knit socks.

233
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,817
Cop shoes,
cop socks.

234
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:46,825
Look...

235
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,759
I'm not a cop.

236
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:59,936
It's $220
for a half-hour,

237
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:02,202
$250 for an hour,

238
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:05,699
and for that
you get "straight,"

239
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:07,974
or "half and half. "

240
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:15,518
what do you say
to that- "Mike"?

241
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:17,749
I say,
"You're under arrest. "

242
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:28,059
You said you
weren't a cop.

243
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,200
I lied.

244
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:33,967
Isn't there some kind of
illegal thing about that?

245
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:35,735
what? Lying?

246
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:39,005
I'm allowed to lie.
They pay me to lie.

247
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:45,041
It doesn't seem right.

248
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:49,182
Maybe we can
work something out.

249
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,089
Like what?

250
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,491
we know you were
with a guy named Diamond

251
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:57,461
the night before last.
what happened?

252
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:01,595
The night before last?

253
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:05,366
I was...

254
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,697
"upstate. "

255
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,506
Max!
Hospital just called.

256
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:14,444
Diamond had
another coronary.

257
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,875
He's dead.

258
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:25,854
I sure hope you have
a plane ticket.

259
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,621
You don't
understand.

260
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:37,363
I didn't realize
he was still alive.

261
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:40,531
I thought
he was dead.

262
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,806
I've never seen
anyone die before.

263
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:47,073
Honey, just tell us
what happened.

264
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:53,011
I called my driver.

265
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:55,850
He was waiting for me
in the garage.

266
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:58,982
He told me to split.

267
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:03,521
So I went home.

268
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,393
You didn't try
to give him CPR?

269
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:08,696
Oh, God! I didn't know
he was still alive.

270
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,565
He wasn't breathing.

271
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:13,765
I got scared,
okay?

272
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:17,037
I would never just
leave somebody to die.

273
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:21,804
Do you think
he would have been-

274
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:23,405
all right?

275
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,713
How did he get
to Central Park?

276
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,377
I don't know.

277
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:33,620
You'd have to ask Cookie.
Cookie Molina.

278
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,559
The driver.

279
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:37,721
where can we
find him?

280
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,924
In his car, I guess.

281
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:43,264
He works out at
the west End Garage.

282
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:49,507
Max: You guys know
a guy named Cookie?

283
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,805
Yeah, he's right
over there. Thanks.

284
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,846
Yo! Cookie Molina?

285
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,851
who wants to know.

286
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:09,087
I thought "Cookie"
was a girl's name.

287
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:11,096
Come on, get out
of the car, get out.

288
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:14,563
Cops!

289
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,397
So, tell us
about Mr. Diamond.

290
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,369
Never heard
of him.

291
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:21,032
Oh! I hope you belong
to a softball league, Cookie.

292
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,938
He must be
an all-star.

293
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:25,842
He's hitting the ball so hard,
he's making it bleed.

294
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,108
Logan: Mr. Diamond
- they found

295
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:30,240
tiny, wooden slivers
in his head.

296
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:32,182
Somebody hit him
with something.

297
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,082
Yeah, something-
like this.

298
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:36,417
Like a bat. Could've
even been this bat.

299
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,355
And since you
don't know Mr. Diamond,

300
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,984
we'll take it down to the
lab and see what they turn up.

301
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:44,462
Look, the guy, Diamond,
was dead before I hit him.

302
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:45,963
Heart attack.

303
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,590
Logan:
Wrong order, Cookie.

304
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,897
Heart attack,
you hit him...

305
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:51,732
then he died.

306
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,965
No way, he was history
in the room.

307
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:56,270
I'm afraid the hospital
where he croaked,

308
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:57,969
would disagree.

309
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,706
why don't you just
talk it through, hmm?

310
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,680
Blow-by-blow.

311
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,441
Jolene beeps me.

312
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,112
I go up-

313
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:09,711
the john's lying there.

314
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,656
He ain't moving.
He ain't breathing.

315
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:14,420
I call Jasmine-

316
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,360
Jasmine?

317
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:19,125
She runs the day-to-day.
I tell her, "we got trouble. "

318
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:21,223
She puts me
on hold,

319
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,257
comes back a minute later and says,

320
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:25,566
"Dress the guy. "
Diamond?

321
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:29,563
Diamond. "Pretend he's
drunk, take him to the car,

322
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,668
dump him someplace,
make it look like a mugging. "

323
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:34,702
So I drive the car
to the park,

324
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:36,714
dump him,
turn out his pockets,

325
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:39,046
toss his key and wallet
into the bushes.

326
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:43,418
Then you hit him. when I
told Jasmine, she freaked.

327
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,446
"what did ya do that for?"
she's screaming.

328
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:48,688
It's not
my fault.

329
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:51,218
She said, "Make it
look like a mugging. "

330
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,060
You did
a good job.

331
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:55,089
I can see
the future.

332
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,934
Oh yeah? You guys are
gonna read me my rights.

333
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,789
Sultry woman:
Hello.

334
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,418
I'm Jasmine.

335
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,428
Hello.

336
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,862
I believe you
asked for me?

337
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:29,029
Yeah.

338
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:38,604
First time?

339
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:41,044
what?!

340
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,876
First time here?

341
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,440
Yeah.

342
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:49,376
well, relax, hmm?

343
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,585
we're gonna have
a good time.

344
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:59,154
Did they explain
the rates downstairs?

345
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,597
No.

346
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:02,623
It's $250
an hour,

347
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:05,637
I... don't
do halves,

348
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:10,506
and I only do
straight sex.

349
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,510
Congratulations-

350
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:15,069
you just said
the magic word.

351
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,419
Look at me,
I'm overweight.

352
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:24,945
Suppose I had a bad
heart like Diamond,

353
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,548
doesn't that
bother you?

354
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:27,991
Give me a break.

355
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:30,426
Does Jack LaLanne
ask for a cardiogram?

356
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:32,987
Johns are big boys.

357
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:34,589
If they choose to go
to an escort i service-

358
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:37,227
You mean "whorehouse", don't you?

359
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,794
You know, you should
have sent your partner.

360
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:42,136
I don't usually
do discipline,

361
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:44,836
but I would love
to teach him some manners.

362
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:56,116
whoa! In and out
- just like work, huh?

363
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:58,384
I'm only as quick
as the guy I'm with.

364
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,789
You- look like
under a minute.

365
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:04,455
Joe, her lawyer-
this guy AuClair,

366
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:06,293
just set a new record,
bail in under an hour.

367
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:08,765
You know anything about
him? He dresses sharp.

368
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,633
Aside from that. I've never seen
him around these parts before.

369
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,160
Not a regular
pross-pumper.

370
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,695
what do you
think?

371
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,901
Of a hooker who's got
a lawyer who looks like

372
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,035
he spends more on clothes
than I make in a year?

373
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:22,012
I think whoever's paying
his bill ought to adopt me.

374
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,419
Logan: what's it been, eight hours?

375
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:31,581
I hate this.

376
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:32,988
what do we got?

377
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,016
well...

378
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,153
Jasmine's lawyer-

379
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:39,220
Roger AuClair, Esquire,

380
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:41,732
has never handled
a pross bust before.

381
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:46,399
In the last three years,
AuClair handled

382
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:48,406
only 34
criminal cases.

383
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,409
Nothing complicated, all
the rest corporate stuff.

384
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:53,570
Favors
for corporate clients.

385
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:56,240
He's the firm's fixer.

386
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:01,844
19 drug-related
charges,

387
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:04,788
seven larceny
or shoplifting,

388
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,085
six assault,

389
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:09,616
wife-beating, husband-beating,
pet poodle-beating.

390
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:12,721
More dropped charges.

391
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,963
what do you say
we pack it in,

392
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,129
catch a couple
or three hours sleep?

393
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,036
Roach coach j is open.

394
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:23,598
Let's get some
fresh coffee.

395
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:27,945
Five possibilities
left, Max.

396
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:32,148
There you go,
have a good day.

397
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,515
Hey!

398
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:35,952
we should have started
at the other end of the pile.

399
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:39,650
Four months ago, AuClair
starts a Theft of Services case

400
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,285
against a guy named
Stringfellow, on behalf of-

401
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:43,885
Poppy Catering!

402
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:46,489
Stringfellow's wife-
she won't pay the bill.

403
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,694
This is the part
of the job that I like.

404
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:52,363
Beautiful, Max.

405
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:56,204
Mrs. Stringfellow: Yes, we are
being sued by Poppy Catering.

406
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:58,675
But, gentlemen,
they are not caterers.

407
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,110
They are whores.

408
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:03,410
Whores
my husband used.

409
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:05,245
And charged
on his gold card.

410
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:09,743
Yes, but I'm sure
I don't need to remind you

411
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:13,656
that a contract entered into
for an illegal act-

412
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:15,557
is void.

413
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,858
In any case,
I certainly

414
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,057
do not intend
to pay this bill.

415
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:22,259
It's the principle
of the thing.

416
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,131
And what about
the publicity?

417
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:26,729
I had a little
research done.

418
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:32,170
The woman who is running
"Poppy Catering,"

419
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,110
this whorehouse,

420
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:37,274
is a winthrop.

421
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:39,579
Laura winthrop.

422
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,643
Her mother
is a Matthews.

423
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:44,348
I went to Spence
with her.

424
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:46,823
Laura...

425
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:48,826
is a very capable
woman.

426
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,725
She holds an MBA
from Harvard.

427
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:55,199
Imagine, my husband
paid $1, 000

428
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:57,258
for four hours' i service.

429
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:02,235
That's almost as much as
I'm paying my divorce lawyer.

430
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,545
Got everything?
we all set?

431
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,775
we got our warrant,
what else do we need?

432
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:12,647
You're cranky when you
don't sleep at night.

433
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:14,652
Cranky?
I love this.

434
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:16,711
Let's go bust
a prostitute.

435
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:19,315
whoo! Look at the
size of this place.

436
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:26,664
Max: Police here to
see Laura winthrop.

437
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:30,062
Search warrant!

438
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:32,968
Max: Laura Winthrop, you have
the right to remain silent

439
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:35,666
and refuse to answer
questions. Do you understand?

440
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:40,134
How does
the defendant plead?

441
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:41,509
Not guilty,
Your Honor.

442
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:43,207
I assume you are
requesting bail?

443
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:44,977
AuClair:.
We are, Your Honor.

444
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:47,951
Prosecution does not consider Ms.
winthrop a flight risk, Your Honor.

445
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:50,011
However, the 35-woman
prostitution ring,

446
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:52,285
which the defendant ran,
is one of the largest

447
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,554
and most lucrative
uncovered in recent years.

448
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:56,891
Listen up, Andrew,
and get some pointers!

449
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:02,030
I gather this is alleged to be
an efficiently run business?

450
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:04,160
Stone: Thoroughly
computerized, with a client list

451
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:05,999
that includes
doctors, diplomats,

452
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:08,505
CEO's of some of the city's
largest corporations-

453
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,871
Judge: Get to the point, Mr. Stone.

454
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:12,103
Despite the impressive
list of assets,

455
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:14,043
promoting prostitution

456
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:16,047
is still merely
a Class D felony.

457
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:18,208
This office requests
bail commensurate

458
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,013
with the serious impact
of the crime

459
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:21,814
on the moral fibre
of this community.

460
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,650
Ya hear that, Andrew?.
Fiber!

461
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:26,020
I told you
we all need fiber!

462
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,550
Ladies
and gentlemen!

463
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:31,585
I realize it's late,

464
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:34,394
and all of us, including me,
would rather be somewhere else,

465
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:38,095
but since we are compelled
to spend some time together,

466
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:39,967
perhaps we could
have a little order?!

467
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:42,599
Bail, $5, 000.

468
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:47,768
Pardon?
watch your step.

469
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:50,280
Reporter:...
excessive? No, not at all.

470
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:53,250
Will this affect your catering
- Yes, and they weren't even invited.

471
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:54,775
And here I am at night
court in my pearls-

472
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:56,081
Counselor!

473
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:57,452
You're treading water.

474
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:59,923
My client invested
in the catering business.

475
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:03,018
She knew nothing about, and had
nothing to do with prostitution.

476
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:06,428
The records we got in the bust give
us a good start proving otherwise.

477
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,728
Circumstantial
at best.

478
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:11,759
See you in court.

479
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:14,931
winthrop:.. This city?
I can't imagine.

480
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:17,908
It stinks.

481
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:20,810
The DA ain't gonna give you
a total walk, Cookie.

482
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:23,541
You want to nail
winthrop?

483
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,016
I can sing you
a top-10 hit,

484
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:29,748
but I gotta slide to a
misdemeanor and time served.

485
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:34,991
Give him
the walk.

486
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:36,687
If people
only knew.

487
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:39,561
Do you know how many
john's heads this jerk

488
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,623
has probably
hit fungos with?

489
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:44,100
I don't care if he's
the damned "Sultan of Swat. "

490
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:46,296
I'm hunting
for bigger fish, Max.

491
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:49,239
Her operation could kill
hundreds. The deal is approved.

492
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,049
"Million Dollar Madam.

493
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,422
Blueblood busted
in prostitution ring.

494
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,892
Cops called her Madame. "

495
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:10,861
what do the telephone records say?

496
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:13,728
No calls to or from her
apartment to the whorehouse.

497
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:15,392
She's smart.

498
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:17,196
But sloppy.

499
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:19,829
Last February- the heat
went off in the whorehouse.

500
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:23,102
winthrop called the people who
managed the building to complain.

501
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:26,167
She was so snobby
on the phone.

502
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:28,873
when she called, she clearly
identified herself?

503
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:31,211
Not just on the phone,
she came in.

504
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:34,912
Oh- would you like
a danish or some coffee?

505
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:37,513
No, thanks. Manager:. what a scene.

506
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:41,082
You know, plumbers are not the
easiest thing to get in New York City.

507
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:44,118
Not in the middle of winter, in
the middle of the dinner hour.

508
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:47,598
I mean, it takes time,
it takes a lot of doing.

509
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:50,032
But not
for "Miss Impatience," no.

510
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:53,162
well, maybe it's easier
in hoity-toity Connecticut.

511
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:56,105
She said she was
from Connecticut? No!

512
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:58,575
She reminds me of my
sister-in-law from Connecticut.

513
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,544
Ma'am, is this the
woman who complained?

514
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:03,479
Yeah.

515
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,177
Yeah, she even looks
like my sister-in-law.

516
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,325
Did you copy
the whole trick book?

517
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:20,991
Just the A-list. 15 names,
each worth over a hundred mil.

518
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:24,661
Phipps MacKenzie,
Colin Metcalf, David Hamilton-

519
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,898
it reads like
the Social Register.

520
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:31,571
Child: One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

521
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:33,736
Anyone around
my base is it!

522
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:35,973
I understand
your position.

523
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:38,107
But you understand,
I'm sure, there's...

524
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:40,242
no way I could
testify.

525
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:42,253
I understand your
position, Mr. Hamilton,

526
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:44,118
but you're gonna
be under subpoena.

527
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:46,885
I don't have to remind you what
the penalties are for perjury.

528
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:48,916
You put me
on the stand,

529
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,428
and I'll make
damn sure you spend

530
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:54,694
the rest of your insignificant
career prosecuting jaywalkers.

531
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:59,333
Thanks for your time,
Mr. Hamilton.

532
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:06,135
And I hope your grandson
has a happy birthday.

533
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,246
Ben!

534
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:26,693
Looking for
our lunch date?

535
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:28,631
I didn't know
we were on for lunch.

536
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:30,224
we're not.

537
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,293
Oh...
Hello, Paul.

538
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:34,396
Still flacking
for the mayor?

539
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:37,772
You know, Paul, I really love your
partner, here, so does the mayor, Ben.

540
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:40,710
He especially loves the work
you've been doing on prostitution.

541
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:44,044
He really thinks you should have
a bigger staff, a bigger budget.

542
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:46,073
Maybe... there should be
a task force,

543
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:49,109
which as you know, since crack
has become much more visible,

544
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:52,521
much more aggressive,
a major task force-

545
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:54,889
major effort.
what do you think, Ben?

546
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:57,258
Are you
interested?

547
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,559
I think we ought to put stocks
- two to a block,

548
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:02,191
guarded and heated
- all the way up and down Broadway.

549
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:04,167
Anyone convicted
of possession of crack

550
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:06,693
has to sit in those stocks
from sunup till sundown,

551
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:10,299
with a dunce cap and clown nose
- we'd clear up the problem in six months.

552
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:11,933
what do you think?

553
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,069
If that's the way you
want to play it, Ben.

554
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:22,683
Gentlemen.

555
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,557
Ms. winthrop's friends
are getting nervous.

556
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:31,061
They're going to be
looking for a scapegoat-

557
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:33,859
like maybe Jolene and Cookie
conspired to roll Diamond.

558
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:37,026
we've got to make sure Jolene
is not connected to Cookie.

559
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:39,036
Check the bat,

560
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,038
make sure her prints
aren't on it.

561
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:43,131
Get a sample of her blood,

562
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:46,507
make sure there's no match with
the blood found on Cookie's bat.

563
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:48,808
All cliches are true.

564
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,212
Such as?

565
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:53,706
"Politics makes
strange bedfellows. "

566
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:01,755
Murder two?!
That's absurd.

567
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:05,160
Diamond died. You can't prove that
was a result of a blow to the head.

568
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:08,597
I think I can prove your client had
reckless disregard for human life.

569
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:10,965
Bull! Yeah? Let's see
what the jury has to say.

570
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,961
Counselor!

571
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,240
All right,
all right.

572
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:20,767
She'll plead to
promoting prostitution.

573
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:23,645
I want her
to do time.

574
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:26,377
what are you,
a religious fanatic?

575
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:29,648
And more than one year.
I want prison, not jail.

576
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:43,260
AuClair wants
to make a deal.

577
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:45,462
And? I'm tempted. Is
that the lab report?

578
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:47,437
The wood fiber found
in Diamond's head matches-

579
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:49,667
Cookie's bat. The
blood type on the bat-

580
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:51,572
Matched Diamond's?
Some of it does.

581
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:54,134
There are other types.
So, what's the problem?

582
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:56,339
All the lab reports j came in-

583
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:58,349
including Jolene's.

584
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:00,613
Her blood
was on the bat?

585
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:03,086
No... it wasn't that,
but...

586
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:06,955
there's a new blind screening
program for HIV.

587
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:09,152
She's got AIDS?

588
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,456
Makes her a hell
of a compelling witness.

589
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,867
The public health angle
is explosive.

590
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:24,363
Actually, I'm glad
you called, Mr. Stone.

591
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:27,003
I've decided
not to testify.

592
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:29,479
I'll plead to
the prostitution charge.

593
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:33,716
I'm sorry.
I really am.

594
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:36,049
I know you were
counting on my testimony,

595
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:38,055
but Laura winthrop's
been good to me.

596
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:39,750
That's not
why we're here.

597
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,921
It's not?!

598
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:48,322
why?

599
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:52,468
The blood sample
that was taken...

600
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:56,769
it became part
of a blind test.

601
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:05,543
what kind of test?

602
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:12,722
An AIDS test?

603
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:15,590
They did an HIV test?

604
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:18,251
Yes.

605
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:22,425
No.

606
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:24,697
No, I was tested.

607
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,466
Two months ago.

608
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:30,099
All positives
are double-checked.

609
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,451
Health food.

610
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:01,502
Robinette: we've got her nailed
on the prostitution charge.

611
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,303
It's the other charges that
are gonna put her behind bars.

612
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:07,311
As my Dad used to say, "Unless
you're holding a full house-

613
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:09,609
jacks high or better-
call, don't raise. "

614
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:11,774
Your dad was
a philosopher.

615
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:14,580
with Jolene and Cookie,
I'm still in the game.

616
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:16,951
Sounds like
a low pair to me.

617
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:24,319
Your wife has been an invalid
for 14 years, is that correct?

618
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:26,557
Yes. Stone: During that time,

619
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:30,499
have you had any occasion to
use the services of prostitutes?

620
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:32,093
witness:
Yes.

621
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:35,299
Stone: How many? Maybe... 2,000.

622
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:40,135
Have you ever used
the same woman twice?

623
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:42,009
Not often.

624
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:45,538
Most of the girls weren't worth
using once, let alone twice.

625
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,448
what about
Jolene Curtis?

626
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:53,252
Jolene?

627
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:55,953
I used her whenever
she was available.

628
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:58,791
She's very, very good
at what she does.

629
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,594
what does she do?

630
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:04,192
Oh, she gets you
very, very excited.

631
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:06,362
whatever she does,

632
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:07,928
is it hard
on the heart?

633
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:12,341
She's hard
on everything.

634
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:20,445
Stone: Mr. Hamilton, can you tell
me about the whipping incident?

635
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:24,353
what I did at Ms. winthrop's
establishment,

636
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:28,415
didn't exactly involve
any whipping.

637
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,427
wasn't a whip
in the room?

638
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:37,694
was anyone
holding the whip?

639
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:42,164
The young lady.

640
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:44,902
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.
would you please speak up?

641
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:48,002
The young woman...

642
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:52,243
was holding the whip.

643
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:54,683
I don't recall her name.

644
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:57,779
Your witness.

645
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:08,597
I know
how awkward-

646
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:10,931
how embarrassing

647
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:13,334
this situation
must be for you.

648
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:16,306
I wonder
if you would mind

649
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,672
elaborating
on your visit

650
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:21,109
to Ms. winthrop's
service?

651
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,907
with the young woman,
about the whip...

652
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:30,587
she only used it
to dress up.

653
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:35,217
Playing...
make-believe?

654
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:37,591
Yes.

655
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:39,960
AuClair:.
Helping to alleviate

656
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:42,090
the perfectly
understandable

657
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:46,297
ennui that comes after
so many years of marriage?

658
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:49,966
They're buying it. Yep.

659
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:52,567
Cookie: Jasmine had to
check with Winthrop whenever

660
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,635
there were problems
with the clients.

661
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:57,341
Stone: These clients, were
they generally healthy or not?

662
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,905
Sure, the service
had clients

663
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,077
who weren't in
the best of health.

664
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:03,814
Men with bad hearts,
like Mr. Diamond?

665
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:06,345
I don't know about
Mr. Diamond's heart.

666
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,518
Did any other of her clients
have bad hearts?

667
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,324
Look, their hearts-

668
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:14,763
that's not the part
of their anatomy

669
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:17,063
the girls were most
involved with.

670
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,497
Answer the question,
Mr. Molina.

671
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:24,770
A lot of the guys
I drive,

672
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:27,437
I heard them complaining
to the girls

673
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:29,173
about their wives,

674
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:31,704
their work.

675
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:34,582
They're a tense breed-
workaholics.

676
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:36,951
what was Ms. winthrop's
attitude toward them?

677
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:38,956
I never met
Ms. winthrop.

678
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:42,653
I know, but you must have overheard
conversations she'd had about them.

679
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:45,560
Yeah, with Jasmine.

680
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:48,497
They were in the coffee
shop near the service.

681
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:51,899
They didn't see me. They were joking
about the "hard-driving johns. "

682
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,836
what was her
attitude?

683
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:55,236
Objection.

684
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,605
Supposition on the part
of the witness.

685
00:37:57,642 --> 00:38:01,100
He has no idea what Ms.
winthrop had in mind.

686
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:03,477
I'll rephrase
the question.

687
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:06,449
Can you tell me exactly
what Ms. winthrop said?

688
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:09,282
Oh, yeah,
it stuck in my mind.

689
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,880
She said,
"A deuce-"

690
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:13,685
that's a two-hour
j session-

691
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:15,885
"will either kill 'em
or cure 'em,

692
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:17,917
and I don't care
which,

693
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,522
as long as their gold
cards are still good. "

694
00:38:20,564 --> 00:38:23,397
AuClair:. Your Honor,
this man is despicable.

695
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:26,096
He's made
a deal to walk.

696
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,970
Yeah, but it didn't
affect my memory.

697
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:38,006
I hear you're in trouble.
Check your sources.

698
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:40,017
Molina gave us an early
Christmas present.

699
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,685
what was AuClair's
reaction?

700
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:46,690
Still wants
to make a deal.

701
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:50,125
Yeah, well...
you want my advice?

702
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,458
Make the deal.

703
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,726
You can't prove
Winthrop gave the order.

704
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:56,790
Why not?

705
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:01,027
what makes this case
so important?

706
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:04,571
Adam,
you got me wrong.

707
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:06,576
Are you going to make
a deal with AuClair?

708
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,908
No, I mean they're
all important.

709
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:13,246
It's going to be
very bad if she walks.

710
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:16,219
She won't walk!

711
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:19,347
Stone: As a member of the
Health and Human Resources Board,

712
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:21,688
you worked on the mayor's
AIDS white paper?

713
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:23,591
I did.
In that report,

714
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:26,289
how many prostitutes were
presumed to be HIV-positive?

715
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:28,821
From 70 to 85%.

716
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:32,495
It's difficult to be more precise
because of the virus' incubation time.

717
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,300
It ranges from months
up to 10 years.

718
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:37,899
Thank you
very much.

719
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:42,402
I only just found out
I've got the AIDS virus.

720
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:45,438
Stone: How many men did you
have sexual intercourse with

721
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:48,714
in the 18 months you worked
for Ms. Laura Winthrop?

722
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,985
800.

723
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:55,651
Maybe 1, 000.

724
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:58,594
Am I missing something
here? she's our witness.

725
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:01,598
watch. And during those 18 months,

726
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:04,465
you worked solely
for Ms. winthrop?

727
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:07,300
Yes. Stone: Your witness.

728
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:14,968
Ms. Curtis...

729
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:16,980
I'm sure that
you're aware,

730
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:19,482
the incubation period
for HIV

731
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:21,712
can be up
to 10 years?

732
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:23,549
Yes.
Ms. Curtis,

733
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,646
j j
were you a virgin

734
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:27,782
before you began
your association

735
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:30,123
with Poppy Escorts?

736
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:34,723
Mmm...

737
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:38,360
A simple "yes" or
"no" will suffice.

738
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,535
No.

739
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:44,234
No further questions.

740
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:47,073
Redirect, Your Honor.
Go ahead, Mr. Stone.

741
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,375
Jolene...

742
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:52,977
before you
went to work-

743
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:56,145
for Ms. Winthrop, how many
men had you slept with?

744
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:58,883
Three.

745
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:02,518
And to your knowledge,
are they all healthy?

746
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:09,561
They're very healthy.

747
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:14,162
The prosecution rests,
Your Honor.

748
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:17,902
AuClair:. Ms. winthrop, are you concerned
about the health of your employees?

749
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:20,570
Yes, I'm quite concerned
about the health of my girls.

750
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:22,579
Along with
regular check-ups,

751
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:24,945
I insist they carry
medical insurance.

752
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,974
You urge them
to seek psychotherapy?

753
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:29,918
Yes, that's one
of the reasons

754
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:32,354
I insist they carry
medical insurance.

755
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:35,256
It pays for the therapy.
We do encourage it.

756
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:37,226
Thank you.

757
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:39,729
Your witness, j sir.

758
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:43,563
Ms. winthrop, this insistence
on health insurance,

759
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:45,159
and medical
check-ups,

760
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:47,170
do you do this
out of altruism?

761
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:50,867
Let's say- enlightened
self-interest.

762
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:52,933
If my male guests were
to pick up a bug-

763
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:55,707
Ms. winthrop, do you
consider AIDS a "bug"?

764
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:58,408
AIDS is a very
serious disease, Mr. Stone.

765
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:01,748
That's why I don't want anyone
in my little family infected.

766
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:04,345
So you screen
prospective employees

767
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:06,083
and if any of them
tested positive-

768
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:07,351
I wouldn't
hire her.

769
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:09,951
And they wouldn't be part
of your "little family"?

770
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:12,053
My "little family"
was the best

771
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:14,530
finishing school
on the East Coast.

772
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:17,329
Girls came to me
without education,

773
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,859
without wit,
without class.

774
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:22,771
I taught them how to speak,
how to dress.

775
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:25,673
After a year, these
i naive young women

776
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,472
leamed
sophistication.

777
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:30,742
And for that, Ms. winthrop,
shame on you.

778
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:33,909
You act as though
I don't care about them.

779
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:35,612
Let's talk about that.

780
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:38,178
Have you ever tried
to help any of these girls,

781
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,417
like the ones
that you didn't hire?

782
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:41,981
No.

783
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:44,290
If they had ever
tested positive for AIDS-

784
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:46,558
They would have to stop
working for me.

785
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:48,428
In the past
three years,

786
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:50,899
how many of your
long-term employees

787
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:52,903
have stopped
working for you

788
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:55,462
because they tested
positive for AIDS?

789
00:42:57,274 --> 00:42:59,037
I'd say
about a dozen.

790
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,442
Have you tried
to help any of them?

791
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:04,311
No.

792
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:06,373
Have you visited
any of them?

793
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:10,319
Have you?

794
00:43:10,354 --> 00:43:12,117
No.

795
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:14,784
Do you even know
what's happened to them?

796
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:17,191
Tried to find out?

797
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:20,258
No.

798
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:22,731
I've never tried
to find out.

799
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:27,733
Ms. winthrop, how much money do you
make from your business in one year?

800
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,966
In this past year?
Yeah.

801
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:32,032
I really
don't know.

802
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:35,336
$100,00?
Probably.

803
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:37,745
One million? I don't think so.

804
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,510
Oh?

805
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:42,280
I do think
you do think so.

806
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:46,915
I think that you made
$1,672,000.

807
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:50,259
At least,
that's what you stated,

808
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:53,559
on your New York State
income tax return.

809
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:55,895
And with all
that money,

810
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:58,834
you didn't help
these girls once.

811
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:01,861
And as for your customers-
Ms. winthrop,

812
00:44:01,905 --> 00:44:03,930
have you ever tried

813
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:06,374
to contact customers

814
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:08,776
and warn them
that they had slept

815
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:11,303
with women who are
HIV-positive?

816
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,352
No.

817
00:44:21,392 --> 00:44:23,360
Ms. winthrop,
I can't hear you.

818
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:25,362
would you please
speak up?

819
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:27,455
No.

820
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:30,296
So isn't it true, Ms. winthrop,
that you are creating

821
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:33,098
an atmosphere of reckless
disregard for human life

822
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:35,605
which must inevitably
lead to someone's death,

823
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:38,005
one way
or another?

824
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,819
All right, Stone,
what do you want?

825
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,787
Make me an offer.

826
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:55,280
winthrop: why don't we hear Mr.
Stone's thoughts on the matter first?

827
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:58,590
I think it might be more appropriate
if you let your lawyer handle this.

828
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:01,598
If you don't mind, I find
this quite fascinating.

829
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,970
How about involuntary
manslaughter?

830
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:15,172
I can be out
in five years, right?

831
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,180
Two and a half
with good behavior.

832
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:20,342
I'm always on my best
behavior, Mr. Stone.

833
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,712
It's a deal.

834
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:45,307
Reporter:. Excuse, me,
Miss, can we get a comment

835
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:46,934
from you on
the winthrop case?

836
00:45:46,977 --> 00:45:48,842
You were the foreman
of the jury,

837
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:51,279
could you tell what the
verdict would have been?

838
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:53,306
I can't speak
for the others-

839
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:55,682
she seemed like
such a nice girl-

840
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:58,620
uh, a real lady.
Still...

841
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:01,180
I probably would have
voted to convict.

842
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:02,692
Thank you.

843
00:46:02,726 --> 00:46:05,695
Robinette: Maybe you
shouldn't have done a deal.

844
00:46:05,729 --> 00:46:08,220
Maybe...

845
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,665
but it ain't bad
for a pair of treys.
